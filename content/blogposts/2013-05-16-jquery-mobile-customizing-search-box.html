Such is the case with the Jquery Mobile search box as well. The designers often use customized icons for the default search box icons. In the example that follows, we will take a look at how this done and we will use custom icons for the search box in place of the default icons.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/U7whe/embedded/result,html,css" width="100%"></iframe><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As seen in the example above, in the CSS, we need to use the <b>!important</b>&nbsp;keyword to override the default styles of the Jquery Mobile class.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Customizing the search box or any other element in Jquery mobile is pretty simple.
