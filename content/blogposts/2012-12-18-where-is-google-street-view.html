<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; &nbsp; Quite a number of people ask this - "Do you know where the Google Street View Cars are currently running?" "Which places have the Google Street View?" These question and so many similar questions are time and again asked on sites like Quora too. I was browsing through the stack of such questions and decided to look for an answer. I am sharing with you all, what I found from Google.<div><br /></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Head to the Google link <a href="http://maps.google.com/help/maps/streetview/learn/where-is-street-view.html">here</a>&nbsp;and you will be able to see a map which shows the availability of the Google Street View images across the globe. Scroll down to the bottom and you will see a drop-down, where you can view the list of places in a particular country where the Google Street View cars are currently driving.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="161" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QDR-cEamJwc/UNBqYGuXwvI/AAAAAAAAA50/tV0sXofXNk0/s400/StreetView.png" width="400" /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><b>Google Map displaying the availability of Street View</b></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b style="font-size: small;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</b></div><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-family: inherit;">T</span><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="line-height: 20px;">he blue overlay shows where Street View imagery is available. You can zoom in to an area to see more detail. The information shown in the "Where our cars are currently driving" section might not always be the most accurate. The reason being, many a times the cars might not be driving in the listed regions due to several unforeseen&nbsp;</span></span><span style="line-height: 20px;">circumstances like weather, bad roads, etc. However, Google tries to maintain a most updated list at this site. Currently, as of December 18, 2012, the Google Street View cars are driving in the following regions of the United States.</span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit; line-height: 20px;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="115" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uMfD3Lph-8U/UNBr312ejfI/AAAAAAAAA6Y/rwxs293r4z0/s400/Regions.png" width="400" /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit; line-height: 20px;">&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit; line-height: 20px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Hope I have answered a very common question among the Google Maps users and fans.
