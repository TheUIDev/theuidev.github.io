This is the 9th post in the ES6 series and we have looked at a whole bunch of some amazing and highly productive ES6 features that you can start using right away! Here is a comprehensive list of all the features that we have covered so far. &#128525;

1. [Fat Arrow Functions](https://theuidev.github.io/es6-fat-arrow-functions/)
2. [Lexical Declarations - Let](https://theuidev.github.io/es6-101-lexical-declarations-let/)
3. [Lexical Declarations - Const](https://theuidev.github.io/es6-101-lexical-declarations-const/)
4. [Spread Operator](https://theuidev.github.io/es6-101-spread-operator/)
5. [Template Literal](https://theuidev.github.io/es6-template-literals/)
6. [Rest Operator](https://theuidev.github.io/es6-rest-operator/)
7. [Default parameters](https://theuidev.github.io/es6-101-default-parameters/)
8. [Destructuring](https://theuidev.github.io/es6-101-destructuring/)

Now let's look at what `for..if` has to offer us. Essentially, `for..of` does exactly the opposite of what `for..in` does. Let's see what the difference is.

```javascript
// Using for..in
let someVar = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for (let item in someVar) {
  console.log(item) // The index values would be consoled.
}
```

When you execute the above code snippet, you will observe that, you get all the index values `0 1 2 3 4` of the array in the console. If you had to get access to the values at these indexes in the array, you would have to add the following to the above snippet in the `for..in` loop.

```javascript
console.log(`${item}'s value is: ${someVar[item]}`)
```

When you execute this, you will get access to the value at each index. `someVar[item]` basically get's you the values from the array.

With ES6, you don't need to do this, as `for..of` does this for you. It actually is that simple and straight-forward. Let's run a small code snippet to confirm.

```javascript
// Using for..of
let someVar = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for (let item of someVar) {
  console.log(item) // All the values would be consoled.
}
```

Using the `for..of` you can iterate over all iterable objects which include `Array`, `Map`, `Set`, `String`, `TypedArray` and so on. However, `Object` is not iterable.

That's it for this post. This was simple and pretty easy. You can get started right away on your code and get migrating to ES6.
