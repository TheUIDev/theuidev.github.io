Responsive website is now the need of the day with a large user base shifting to mobile devices to browse the web on the go! This is not a relatively new concept, but I came across 2 really nice info-graphics regarding "Responsive Websites" that talk about the mobile web design and the responsive website design or the responsive template. I would like to share these with you all.

The first info-graphic is courtesy of [SPINX](http://www.spinxdigital.com/) explaining **Why Responsive Websites are Key in a Multi Device World**!

The next info-graphic courtesy of [Splio](http://splio.com/) and provides 10 basic tips to developers that they can remember while building responsive websites.
