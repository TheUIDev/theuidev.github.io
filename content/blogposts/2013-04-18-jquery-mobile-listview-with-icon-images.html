<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; &nbsp; We have seen a number of examples on Jquery Mobile's listview and in continuation to the series of <a href="http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.in/p/jquery-mobile.html" target="_blank">these examples</a>, we will take a look at how we can add an icon to a listview. This icon will be positioned to the extreme left of the listview as we have the regular right arrow icon on the right of the listview.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Adding an icon to the left of the text in a list item is pretty simple. Just add an image tag inside of the list item as the first child and add class ui-li-icon to this image element. The image would scale to a 16x16 pixel icon and positioned to the left of the list item text.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Let's take a look at the example below to understand how this is actually implemented.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/TmHxA/embedded/result,html,resources" width="100%"></iframe><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Hope you have followed the example above. Drop a line in case you need further explanation on this or have any doubts. I would be more than happy to help!<br /><br /></div>
