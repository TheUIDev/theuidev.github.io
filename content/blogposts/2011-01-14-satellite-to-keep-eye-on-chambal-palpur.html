&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a bid to check the rising incidents of poaching and keep an eye on  the flora and fauna of the two sanctuaries in Madhya Pradesh, the government  has decided to use satellite to monitor the Chambal and Palpur Kuno  region.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basic field technique, which is used currently, to maintain a log of  the region’s vegetation, wildlife does not give the real time data.  Therefore, the government has decided to use the Geographical  Information System (GIS) Global Positioning System (GPS) for the  purpose.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madhya Pradesh’s leading animal scientist Dr. RJ Rao, who has  received training in such satellite monitoring of national reserves from  California, said the program ‘ARC Q-9’ is proving to be of great use in  protection of the wildlife. They have used the program to prepare a database of the whole Chambal and Kuno region, said Rao.<br /><br />Source: <a href="http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/MP-BHO-satellite-to-keep-eye-on-chambal-palpur-kuno-sanctuaries-1751407.html">DaynikBhaskar</a>
