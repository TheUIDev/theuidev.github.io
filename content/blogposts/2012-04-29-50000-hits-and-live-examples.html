<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello to all the blog readers - to the regulars and the first timers. Spatial Unlimited just crossed the 50,000 all time hits milestone and so its time to celebrate and also mark the occasion with something new and interesting.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="361" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9zWakd_G4_0/T51xWHOA-YI/AAAAAAAAAvc/FzaFLF9Rnm8/s400/50000+hits.jpg" width="400" />&nbsp;</div><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new addition to this blog is that, you will now be able to enjoy the codes live on the blog. I am adding some life to the blog by converting all the earlier life-less codes to JsFiddle powered live examples. I have converted a few and am sharing the links here. Please share your feedback and let me know what you think of the new additions. Hope you keep enjoying the blog as much as I enjoy updating it! Cheers!<br /><br /><b>Links to Live Examples:</b><br />1. <a href="http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.in/2010/11/simple-map-using-google-maps-api-v3.html">Simple Google Map</a><br />2. <a href="http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.in/2010/11/simple-marker-example.html">Simple Map Marker</a><br />3. <a href="http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.in/2010/11/multiple-markers.html">Multiple Markers</a><br />4. <a href="http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.in/2011/02/kml-layer-example.html">KML Layer</a> </div>
