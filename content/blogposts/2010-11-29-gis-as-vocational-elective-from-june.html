&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As 13 schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education  (CBSE) across India are set to introduce a course on ‘geospatial  practices’, a vocational elective for Std XI and XII from 2011,  principals and teachers will be trained by an industry partner on ways  to implement the programme, next month in Mumbai. The course will be  expanded to other schools later.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the 13 schools, RN Podar School in Santa Cruz will be the first  school in Mumbai that will introduce this course which focuses on  various components of geographic information system/geospatial  information systems (GIS) and remote sensing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GIS is an emerging field and there is a lot of demand for candidates who are  trained in GIS applications and technology today. It has a lot of  relevance and so far no school has been providing education in this  field. The subject is inter-disciplinary and covers various areas like  geography, physics and mathematics, to name a few.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rolta India will conduct a workshop in December to train the school  teachers and principals from across the country who are offering this  course, which will be formally launched in June 2011. Rolta India has developed the curriculum and will also help schools to implement it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The workshop will orient teachers towards the course content and ways to  approach it. Further, since Rolta India is giving some software to the  schools, it will also train teachers on ways to use it. It is good to see that students will be introduced to GIS as a subject so early in their educational phase!
