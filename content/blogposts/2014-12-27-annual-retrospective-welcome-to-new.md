The curtains are about to fall and another year will have gone by. A brief interval, the curtains go up and we would be looking forward to the next year - **2015**! 🎊 This past year, I wrote comparatively few posts, but some really good ones. Though I have shared a few posts this year round, I have learned new things and techniques this year. I have upgraded my skills and am looking forward to put these to use in the new year and share new things with you all.

I did a retrospective of what I shared during the last year and the data has revealed the top-shared and read posts over the last year. I present to you the top 5 posts of the last year.

- [Exploring Jquery Mobile 1.4.0](https://theuidev.github.io/exploring-jquery-mobile-140)
- [Material UI, Google Polymer & Web Components](https://theuidev.github.io/material-ui-google-polymer-web/)
- [Difference between word-break: break-all versus word-wrap: break-word](https://theuidev.github.io/difference-between-word-break-break-all/)
- [The bitter divorce of PSD and HTML](https://theuidev.github.io/the-bitter-divorce-of-psd-and-html/)
- [Setting up a Sandbox for Google Polymer](https://theuidev.github.io/setting-up-sandbox-for-google-polymer/)

This year ~~[Spatial Unlimited](http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.com/)~~ [The UI Dev](https://theuidev.github.io) crossed the 300K visits mark. 🙌🏻 All thanks to you readers and all of you who wanted to learn something new and liked what I shared. A heart felt thank you to all of you readers! Keep reading and giving your feedback. I also have set up a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/SpatialUnlimited) for ~~Spatial Unlimited~~ The UI Dev and you can stay connected with me here as well. You can share new things on this page, ask questions and we can try to find solutions to some problems and issues in front-end web development together.

So far I have been writing from India 🇮🇳 and now am writing from a new postal address in USA 🇺🇸. It's a new year, new techniques, new skills and a new place. A perfect recipe to share some great techniques and articles with the community. Things are looking bright and I am hoping to write more this year! Hope you all had a great year too and wish you all a very happy new year 2015! Stay tuned for more updates and new things. See you in the new year!
