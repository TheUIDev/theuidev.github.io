![200K hits](/blog/200K.jpg)

Iâ€™m so excited that I have finally reached this milestone. **200K blog hits**! ðŸ™Œ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽˆðŸŽˆðŸŽˆ Yes, we have crossed 200K visits. I never thought when I started this blog in November, 2010 that I would have much to offer that people would appreciate so much. But today with more than 200,000 page views, more than 500 followers and several Likes and +1s the response to this blog has been nothing short of amazing. Now I have the added responsibility of contributing better code samples and better articles.

I would like to thank all visitors and members for making this blog successful. I am so happy to have readers such as you. Thank you all who have been reading. If you are a regular reader, or if you just dropped by today, do comment and tell me what you liked about the blog!
