<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set for release in February 2012, a game based on Google Maps will be added to the Google+ Games Collection. The new game based on Google Maps, developed by the Google Maps team was promoted in a short <a href="http://youtu.be/TVum3HsmZ6M">video clip</a>. The game is developed based on WebGL which allows users to view 3D graphics without having to install any additional plugins.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the tag line "Play your world, like never before", the game is set on a cube board that the user can tilt to navigate a small blue ball through various locations, both indoor and outdoor. Each side of the cube features a different geographic section of the world. The goal appears to be to hit various markers along the way.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xqj3EKrYp2Q/TxLmpowhHUI/AAAAAAAAAhU/zmXQItfggIo/s1600/google+maps+game.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="218" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xqj3EKrYp2Q/TxLmpowhHUI/AAAAAAAAAhU/zmXQItfggIo/s400/google+maps+game.png" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div></div>
