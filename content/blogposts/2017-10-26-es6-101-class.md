After a short break, I am back with a new ES6 feature today and it is `class`. Classes in ES6 are what prototype-based inheritance was in ES5. See how I am using past tense for ES5 &#128523; So more or else, `class` provides some level of syntactical sugar-coating over the existing ES5 prototype-based syntax.

Let's just dive into the syntax and we can cover the concepts as we break up the code. The full code snippet is at the very end of this post, in case you wan to just jump there and read the comments and understand the code & the concepts. (It's pretty self-explanatory!) &#128526; We will be covering some key concepts here which include the following.

1. Class definition
2. Constructor
3. Extending a class
4. Sub-classing methods
5. Static methods

## Class definition

We can either use the **declaration-form** or the **expression-form** to define/decalre a new `class` in ES6. Our example uses the **declaration-form** to define a class, but I will also show how to use the **expression-form**. Expression-form names the class. Let's see what I mean!

#### Declaration-form

```javascript
class Polygon {
  constructor() {}
  methods() {}
}
```

#### Expression-form

#### Named expression

```javascript
let Polygon = class Polygon {
  constructor() {}
  methods() {}
}
```

or even

#### Name-less expression

```javascript
let Polygon = class {
  constructor() {}
  methods() {}
}
```

## Constructor method

Every new class has a constructor method by default. You can override it based on your requirements. In our example we are overriding the constructor method because there are a few parameters we expect to create a Polygon.

## Extending a class

We don't need `prototype` anymore. There is a new keyword `extends` that does the job for you. In our example we have a base Polygon class and then we create a new class called Square or Circle which `extends` this base Polygon class. Let's take a look.

```javascript
class Polygon {
  test() {
    console.log('Just a basic Base Class')
  }
}
class Square extends Polygon {
  // Now class Square has access to all non-static methods of base class Polygon
}
let smallSquare = new Square()
console.log(smallSquare.test()) // Just a basic Base Class
```

It's that simple. No more hassle of prototype and feels more natural and a lot like other programming languages. &#128526;

## Sub-classing methods of the parent class

Sub-classing a method of the parent class basically means that you override a method of the parent class in a class that extends it. In our example we have a method called "perimeter" in our base class "Polygon". In class "Circle" which extends this base class, we override the method "perimeter". Let's take a look.

```javascript
class Polygon {
  constructor(length = 10, breadth = 10) {
    this.len = length
    this.breadth = breadth
    this.name = 'Polygon'
  }
  perimeter() {
    return 2 * this.len + 2 * this.breadth
  }
}
class Circle extends Polygon {
  // Sub class the perimeter method in class Polygon
  perimeter(radius) {
    const PI = 3.14
    return 2 * PI * radius
  }
}
```

So now if you create an instance of the class "Circle" as say `circle` then you can actually call the permiter method as `circle.perimeter(10)` and then get the desired output.

## Static methods

A static method is defined by appending a metohd with the keyword `static`. Simply put a **static method can be accessed by the class only and not by the instance of the class**. Basically, this is what will happen...

```javascript
class Polygon {
  static sides() {
    console.log(
      'A polygon is a figure with more than 3 equal or unequal sides! A circle is not a Polygon.'
    )
  }
}
console.log(Polygon.sides()) // No problem here. Statement will be output to the console.
let myPoly = new Polygon() // myPoly is an instance of Polygon
console.log(myPoly.sides()) // Uncaught TypeError: myPoly.sides is not a function
```

A static method of a parent class can however be accessed by a class that extends it, using the super keyword. Something like `myPoly.super.sides()`.

This has been a long post, but `class` in ES6 is one of the most important features and is a pretty important one at that. Hope you have understood the syntax and how to use it. You can start modifying your existing prototype based functions to start consuming the new class syntax.

With this we conclude the 12th article in the ES6 101 series. The example that follows is the full example with comments that shows all the concepts above. You can copy the code from the snippet below and paste it in your browser console to see the output and tweak it further.

## ES6 class example

```javascript
// Declarative-form class construction
// This is our base class
class Polygon {
  // constructor method
  constructor(length = 10, breadth = 10) {
    this.len = length
    this.breadth = breadth
    this.name = 'Polygon'
  }
  area() {
    return this.len * this.breadth
  }
  perimeter() {
    return 2 * this.len + 2 * this.breadth
  }
  // Static method that can be access only by this class, not by it's instance
  static sides() {
    console.log(
      'A polygon is a figure with more than 3 equal or unequal sides! A circle is not a Polygon.'
    )
  }
}

// New class extending the base class
class Square extends Polygon {
  constructor(length) {
    super(length, length)
    this.name = 'Square'
  }
}

// New class extending the base class
class Circle extends Polygon {
  // Sub class the perimeter method in class Polygon
  perimeter(radius) {
    const PI = 3.14
    return 2 * PI * radius
  }
  // Static method of this class can access the static method of the class it extends.
  static sides() {
    return super.sides()
  }
}

// Create new instances of the above classes
const defaultSquare = new Square()
const square20 = new Square(20)
const rect = new Polygon(10, 20)
const circle = new Circle()

// Try and access various methods and properties of the classes above
console.log(defaultSquare.area())
console.log(square20.area())
console.log(rect.area())
console.log(circle.perimeter(10))
console.log(Circle.sides())
console.log(rect.sides()) // Uncaught TypeError: rect.sides is not a function
console.log(square20.super.sides()) // Uncaught TypeError: square20.super.sides is not a function
```
