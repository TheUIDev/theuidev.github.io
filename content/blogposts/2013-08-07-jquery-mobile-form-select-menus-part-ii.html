<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; &nbsp; In part II of this tutorial on creating select menus using Jquery Mobile, we will discuss some customization techniques like overriding the default native OS select menu or disabling an option or creating a multi-select select box. It is advisable that you take a look at <a href="http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.in/2013/08/jquery-mobile-form-select-menus-part-i.html" target="_blank">part I</a> of this tutorial where we have discussed the basics of the select menu. In case you have decided to proceed with this part, then we are ready to take a look at the code that follows.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/E899P/embedded/result,html" width="100%"></iframe><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; In the example code above, you will observe 2 different selects. We will be discussing the following data attributes and HTML5 properties that will enhance the select menus further.<br /><br />1. data-native-menu="false"<br />2. data-placeholder="true"<br />3. disabled<br />4. multiple<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As seen in the first implementation, by adding the data attribute <b>data-native-menu="false"</b> we can simply override the native OS menu control and display a pop-up containing the options in a listview. If there are a large number of options,&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">the framework will automatically create a new "page" populated with a standard listview&nbsp;for the options.</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">&nbsp; &nbsp; To create a placeholder for the select we just need to include a data attribute <b>data-placeholder="true"</b>&nbsp;to an option which holds the placeholder text. This option will then be styled accordingly and will not be selectable. In case you want to disable an option just add <b>disable</b>&nbsp;to that option and that option will be styled as a disabled listview. All the above three things are part of the first implementation in the above example.</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Lets now take a look at how to create a multi select select box. It is as simple as it sounds a big task. Just add keyword <b>multiple</b>&nbsp;to your select element (as seen in the second implementation) and the framework will style each of your option as a listview with a checkbox and you can select multiple options. Each of the options selected will be populated as comma seperated list on the custom select button. To top this off Jquery Mobile framework will aslo add a count bubble on the select button indicating how many options are selected.</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Hope you have enjoyed this post and the other <a href="http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.com/p/jquery-mobile.html" target="_blank">form elements tutorials</a>.
