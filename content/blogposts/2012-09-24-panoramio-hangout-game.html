<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Google has launched a new web based game powered by the Panoramio and Google+ Hangouts platform. The concept of the game is to guess where a photo was taken on Google Maps. You compete with your friends to make the best     guess.&nbsp;The game is played in rounds. In every round, one player is     the <i>round master</i> and the other players are the <i>guessers</i>. The     round master chooses a photo. Then the other players take guesses at where     the photo was taken from. When the time is up, the player who made the best     guess wins, and becomes the round master for the next     round.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.panoramio.com/game"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-O9_rHXSeZJM/UGBKkfgv4wI/AAAAAAAAAyE/uPgh2hAJyK0/s400/panoramio_hangout_game900x544.png" width="400" /></a></div><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In more detailâ€¦</span><br />    <ol><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">The round master sees a map. He or she can drag and zoom       the map, or enter a place name in the search box. Meanwhile, the guessers       need to wait.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Next to the map, the round master sees a selection of       photos from the area shown in the map.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">The round master chooses a photo by clicking on       it.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">If the round master is satisfied with the photo, he can       click on "start round with this photo" to start the       round.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Then all the other players will see the photo, a world       map, and a countdown.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Each guesser can drag and zoom the map, or enter a place       name in the search box. Once he thinks he knows where the photo was taken       from, he can click on the map to drop a pin at the chosen position. Until       the round ends, he can click more times to change his guess. Meanwhile,       the round master will see the guesses of every       player.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">When the countdown reaches zero, the round ends. The       player whose guess is closest to the place where the photo was taken       wins. Every guesser gets some points based on how good his guess was. The       winner becomes the round master for the next       round.</span></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Following are a few tips that will help you master the game:</span></div><div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">You need to guess the       place <span class="hangout_game_landing-emphasized_tip"><b>where the camera       stood</b></span> when the photo was taken, not the place that is shown on the       photo. So you thought this was an easy round, because you recognized the       Empire State Building in New York? Think again. All other players will       recognize it too, but who will find the exact corner where the       photographer was standing?</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">You       can <span class="hangout_game_landing-emphasized_tip"><b>change your guess       any number of times</b></span> until the time runs out. So       <span class="hangout_game_landing-emphasized_tip">start with a rough       guess, and get closer</span> and closer if you have time. It's better to       be wrong by a thousand miles, than not to guess at       all!</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;"><span class="hangout_game_landing-emphasized_tip"><b>Precision counts</b>.</span> Google has designed the scores so that every little improvement counts. Once       you've found the right country, try to guess the city too. Then the       building, then the exact point on the street. Or, if it's a countryside       picture, try to find the correct point in the path, not just the correct       mountain. That is, if you have time. Every little improvement will give       you a score boost that can be very valuable, if you play multiple rounds,       to make up for an unlucky guess later.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">It's in a Hangout! You       can <span class="hangout_game_landing-emphasized_tip"><b>ask the round master       for hints</b></span>, you can send other players on the wrong track; you can       all gang up against the round master, and instead of competing to make the       best guess, try to be the round master that chooses the most difficult       picture. It's your game.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">You make it fun: If you are the round master, you need       to <span class="hangout_game_landing-emphasized_tip"><b>choose a good       photo</b></span>. Sunsets look the same everywhere, so the game will be boring       if you choose a photo of one. If the photo is too hard, you may want to       give some hints.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">The <span class="hangout_game_landing-emphasized_tip"><b>more people</b></span> you play       with, the <span class="hangout_game_landing-emphasized_tip"><b>higher the       scores get</b></span>. If you want to improve your high score, play with more       friends. You'll see that you will get higher scores even though your       guesses are equally successful if more people take a guess in that       round.</span></li></ol><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; The photos that are used in this game come from&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.panoramio.com/"><img border="0" height="46" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gstik2DEE1A/UGBMWBh077I/AAAAAAAAAyM/32ZKvOb-YxQ/s200/logo-panoramio-google.gif" width="200" /></a><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">, a community-powered website for exploring places through&nbsp;photography: cities,     natural wonders, or anywhere you might go.
