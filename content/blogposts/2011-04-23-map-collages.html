Think again.  Artist Matthew Cusick cuts away pieces on maps, atlases, encyclopedias  and school textbooks, to create crazy collages that look like drawings  or paintings. "I like to catalog, archive, and arrange information and  then dismantle, manipulate, and reconfigure it," he says.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cusick flips around road, river and transit lines, piecing them together  to form everything from portraits to landscapes. While Cusick sometimes  adds paint (like acrylic) to these pieces, by and large, the colors are  taken from the maps' topography. Cusick explains how he got started with working with maps:<br /><br /><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); color: #666666; margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;"><div style="text-align: center;">About nine years ago, frustrated with paint and brushes, I just started  experimenting with some maps I had laying around the studio. I found  that maps have all the properties of a brushstroke: nuance, density,  line, movement, and color. Their palette is deliberate and symbolic,  acting as a cognitive mechanism to help us internalize the external. And  furthermore, since each map fragment is an index of a specific place  and time, I could combine fragments from different maps and construct  geographical timelines within my paintings.</div></blockquote><div><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Browse the works of Matthew Cusick on his <a href="http://www.mattcusick.com/paintings-collage/map-works">website</a>.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this is called creativity with maps! Anyone out there with such innovative map creativity?!?</div><span style="color: black;"></span><span style="color: black;"></span><span style="color: black;"></span></div>
