<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span class="verdana12black1a height18a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mumbai's Metro rail system,  which is scheduled to take off by next year, will have a Geographic  Information System (GIS) for mapping the entire rail tracks and nearby  areas to enhance safety, maintenance and traffic regulation.<br />Mumbai Metro One Pvt. Ltd. (MMOPL) - the special purpose vehicle  promoted by Reliance Infrastructure, Mumbai Metropolitan Region  Development Authority (MMRDA) and French multinational firm Veolia - is  implementing the GIS along the Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar (VAG) corridor  in Phase-I of the project. This is a first-of-its-kind initiative in the  country for Metro rail management.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The GIS system will map the exact location of the trains and all  emergency services, including fire stations, police stations and  hospitals along the alignment. In case there is a fire incident or other  emergencies, the exact location of the nearest fire station or police  station can be identified with the help of the GIS map to ensure speedy  response.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MMOPL is building Phase-I of Mumbai's metro project on an 11-kilometer route between Versova and Ghatkopar. GIS,  which leverages the power of Global Positioning System (GPS) for  real-time asset tracking and monitoring, can map data in various layers  and represent it in the form of a map.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A land base data for the entire Mumbai city is already with the  company. Once the construction of the VAG corridor is complete,  locations of the piers, viaduct and stations will be imported into the  GIS. Each layer in the GIS will map a certain feature along the Metro-I  alignment. There are layers pertaining to trees, tracks, piers,  building, rolling stock, bridges, roads, distribution transformers and  utilities.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of these layers can be selected or deselected as per the  requirement. GIS will also be useful in maintenance of the system, like  diversion of traffic if required when the whole system takes off. With the help of GIS maps, the exact location of the fault along the  network can be determined and a team can be dispatched immediately for  speedy maintenance.</span></div>
