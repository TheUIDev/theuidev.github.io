There is not a huge deal of stuff that I have done or am doing, but am doing my bit! I am UI developer by profession and by choice! I love the ever changing landscape of UI and try my best to keep track of things! I am currently working with [Macy's Inc.](https://www.macys.com) as a ***Sr. UI Developer (e-Commerce)***. I am part of their foundational UI team working on the [Macy's mobile website](https://m.macys.com).

I have authored a book titled [Mastering jQuery Mobile](http://a.co/eY5mY7I) published by [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/). The framework seems to be dying out now, but at one point it was ***THE*** mobile framework to build all your mobile websites. I also have been a technical reviewer for a couple for their titles in web UI development.

I started writing this blog with the intension of logging what I have studied and also sharing it with the world as a by-product. I would love to get your feedback on any of the articles I post on the blog. Drop me a line and I should get back to you pretty quickly. Feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shreerangp)!
