![Happy Diwali](/assets/blog/happy_diwali.jpg)
We are already on the brink of the new year and the festival of lights is already here!

May this festival of lights, bring joy, peace and prosperity to you and your loved ones! Wishing you a very happy Diwali and a prosperous new year!

For your holiday family portraits and baby shoots I would recommend a really talented and professional photographer in the SF Bay Area. Her [portfolio](http://akshataphotography.com/) would speak for itself!

Happy holidays and have a safe Diwali!
