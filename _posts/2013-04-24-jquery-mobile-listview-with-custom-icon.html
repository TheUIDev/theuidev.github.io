<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; &nbsp; This is the last post in the <a href="http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.in/p/jquery-mobile.html" target="_blank">series of Jquery Mobile listviews</a> before we move on to Jquery Mobile accordions (collapsibles) and then a series on form elements in Jquery Mobile. Today we will see how to add a custom made, third-party icon in listview instead of the standard icons provided by Jquery mobile.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Wondering how to customize a list view, or adding a custom icon to a listview. Well there are 2 ways in which you can do this and we will see both.<br /><br /><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; The easy way #1:</b><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Jquery Mobile provides the developers with creating a custom icon class something like a <i>.ui-icon-custom</i>&nbsp;and then adding data attribute data-icon="custom" to the list item. Let us take a look at the example that follows. This example would make things all the more clear.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/3WNay/2/embedded/result,html" width="100%"></iframe><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>The difficult way #2 (My personal&nbsp;favourite):</b><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Now adding a custom icon to listview done in this way would help you explore how Jquery Mobile works or resolve some issues like "<a href="https://forum.jquery.com/topic/changing-the-default-x-icon-in-the-dialogs-header" target="_blank">How to change the default "X" icon in the dialogs header</a>" where you cannot use the easy way #1. Let's take a look at the example below and see how we can customize the listview.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/R7AGd/embedded/result,html,css" width="100%"></iframe><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Hope you find this customization process important.
