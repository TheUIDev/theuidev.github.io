<div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An archaeological team, led by T M Keshava from Bangalore, discovered  maps that date back to 1500-2000 BC. The place is located around  Tungabhadra River near Hampi in Karnataka, India. Unlike modern maps  that rely on technology, ancient men banked on their eyesight and  memory.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The map was depicted on the roof of caves of Chikramapura  village. What was once thought to be a megalithic burial site with just  paintings of animals and humans; is proof of the prehistoric man’s  cartographic skill. Keshava’s finding is believed to be the first-ever aerial map of a region drawn by a prehistoric man. While  paintings of animals such as cows, hunting scenes and human figurines  are common across pre-historic settlements, only the Chikramapura  village caves, also called Kadebagilu rock shelters, feature maps.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “A  previous study in 1984 at these caves by scholars like Dr R Sundara had  concluded they were just megalithic burials, but we can now say that  they are maps,” Keshava said. According to Keshava, the  prehistoric man obtained a bird’s eye view of an area by climbing a  hillock and standing at a vantage point. He would then observe his  settlement — houses, pathways, waterbodies, etc. With these images in  mind, he would paint them in his cave. “We compared them with the  present maps and we were dumbstruck with the findings,” he said.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Researchers found many similarities with the modern-day maps. The  triangular marks used to represent hillocks on these maps are similar to  the symbols used by surveyors. Further, the narrow passage has  been compared to the figure of a human being, while the ladder-like  symbol indicates a pathway. It took Keshava and his team almost a year  to confirm the findings.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The paintings have been depicted on  granite and done with red laterite clay. The circular-shaped settlement  is 35 metres in radius. “However, due to the exposure to elements, some  parts of the paintings have got spoilt,” said an archaeologist.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">Source: <a href="http://www.bangaloremirror.com/article/10/201012282010122800143099935a21882/Prehistoric-man-drew-maps.html">Banglore Mirror</a></div>
