The eclipse will be visible in the region covering   Europe, West Africa, the Americas, the Pacific Ocean, eastern  Australia,  the Philippines and eastern and northern Asia. Whereas this  eclipse is  not visible in India.<br /><br /><b>Timings As Per Indian Standard Time (IST): </b><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Broadly speaking the Eclipse begins at 10.58 a.m. IST passing through various phases and ends at 4. 36 p.m. IST.
