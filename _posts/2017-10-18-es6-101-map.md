ES6 ```Map``` is the topic of today's post which also is the 11th in the ES6 101 Series. Map is going to be fairly easy, so before jumping into it, if you want to look at other features we have covered so far, here is a quick list for your reference.
1. [Fat Arrow Functions](https://theuidev.github.io/es6-fat-arrow-functions/)
2. [Lexical Declarations - Let](https://theuidev.github.io/es6-101-lexical-declarations-let/)
3. [Lexical Declarations - Const](https://theuidev.github.io/es6-101-lexical-declarations-const/)
4. [Spread Operator](https://theuidev.github.io/es6-101-spread-operator/)
5. [Template Literal](https://theuidev.github.io/es6-template-literals/)
6. [Rest Operator](https://theuidev.github.io/es6-rest-operator/)
7. [Default parameters](https://theuidev.github.io/es6-101-default-parameters/)
8. [Destructuring](https://theuidev.github.io/es6-101-destructuring/)
9. [For..of](https://theuidev.github.io/es6-101-forof/)
10. [Set](https://theuidev.github.io/es6-101-set/)

Now let's see what ```Map``` has to offer. As opposed to [Set](https://theuidev.github.io/es6-101-set/) (which by the way, I highly recommend reading), Map saves values as key-value pair. Let's see for ourselves how this works!

## Example of ES6 ```Map```
```javascript
var dummyMap = new Map();

dummyMap.set("1"); // Method is set as against add in ES6 Set
console.log(dummyMap); // [["1",null]]

dummyMap.set("1", "one");
console.log(dummyMap); // [["1","one"]]

dummyMap.set("2", "two").set("3","three");
console.log(dummyMap); // [["1","one"],["2","two"],["3","three"]]

console.log(dummyMap.size); //3

console.log(dummyMap.get("2")); // two

console.log(dummyMap.has("3")); // true
console.log(dummyMap.has("two")); // false

for(let item of dummyMap){
    console.log(item); // Lists out all the key-value pairs in the Map
    console.log(`Numeric ${item[1]} is: ${item[0]}`); // Numeric one is: 1 and so on for each key-value pair in the Map
}

dummyMap.delete("3");
console.log(dummyMap); // [["1","one"],["2","two"]]

dummyMap.clear();
console.log(dummyMap); // []

```
Pretty simple as always! Very easy to implement and this makes me fall in love with these ES6 features more and more.&#128525; Anyways, let's see what all things can we gather from this code snippet above.
1. To add a key-value pair to a ```Map``` you use the method ```set``` as against ```add``` used with ```Set```. That is because we can add single values in a Set, but a Map creates an array of key-value pairs.
2. If you do set only one value as we did with ```dummyMap.set("1")```, the value of this key would be set to ```null``` and if you try and get access to this value, you will get ```undefined```.
3. If you try and insert a new key-value pair which has a key that already exists in the Map, then the original key-value pair will be over-written.
4. The size property returns the length of the map.
5. The ```get``` method accepts the key as a parameter and returns the value of that key.
6. The ```has``` method checks if a key-value pair exists in the Map based on the key. It does not accept the value as a parameter.
7. You can run a ```for..of``` loop on the Map and then get access to each key-value pair as an array and then even access the independant values of the key and it's value from this array.
8. the ```delete``` method deletes that particular key-value pair from the Map
9. The ```clear``` method wipes off the entire Map.

That's pretty much it! This is ES6 Map for you guys. Pretty awesome. Provides the developers with much better control over an object than before. Make sure you start using this right away and let me know how you are using it in the real world code.
