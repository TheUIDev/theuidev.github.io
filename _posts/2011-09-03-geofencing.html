<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's post is cross-posted from <a href="http://gislounge.com/">GIS Lounge</a>.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With all the location-based social media applications out there, it’s  only logical that, in addition to being able to restrict access based on  ones social groups (or circles), that geographic boundaries also be  used as a restrictive parameter. &nbsp;That capability is called a geofence, a  virtual way to set the geographic boundaries that a user wants to fence  off for privacy reasons or to trigger a specific action.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Flickr recently made news with the introduction of its <a href="http://www.popphoto.com/news/2011/08/flickr-brings-privacy-to-gps-geofences" target="_blank" title="Flickr's Geofences Offer More Privacy With Geotagged Photos">geofence privacy feature</a>. Users can draw circles on a map to delineate the geographic area they  want to create viewing restrictions for certain geotagged photos. &nbsp;Once a  geofenced area is delineated, specific users can be flagged with  permissions to view those photos. &nbsp;Up to ten geofenced areas can be  drawn. &nbsp;The <a href="http://code.flickr.com/blog/2011/08/30/in-the-privacy-of-our-homes/" target="_blank" title="Geofencing explained on the Flickr Blog">Flickr blog has more details</a>&nbsp;about  the brainstorming that led to this new geofence feature and specifics  about the feature itself (and if you want to get into more of the nitty  gritty of Flickr’s geofencing, <a href="http://code.flickr.com/blog/2011/09/01/the-code-behind-geofences/" target="_blank" title="The Code Behind Geofences">there is a followup post</a>).  &nbsp;Once a geofence is set up, the privacy settings are retroactively  applied to all geotagged photos within the restricted area. &nbsp;The feature  is a great way to mask a user’s home location or to prevent sensitive  locations such as a child’s school from being revealed through  inadvertent geotagging.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cX7awDH5fCg/TmJWve3CTdI/AAAAAAAAAeY/Un_Qt7Yd5hk/s1600/flickrgeofencing.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="223" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cX7awDH5fCg/TmJWve3CTdI/AAAAAAAAAeY/Un_Qt7Yd5hk/s400/flickrgeofencing.jpg" width="400" />&nbsp;</a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Geofencing has other applications in addition to privacy purposes.  Geofencing can also be applied to notify users when their geographic  location meets certain criteria. &nbsp;Geofencing commonly is used for  notifications when a user enters or leaves a designated area, such as  tracking a parolee via GPS who has to remain within a specific area. &nbsp;An  example of a commercial application would be a user searching for new  homes. &nbsp;When the user (along with his or her GPS enabled smartphone) is  within a specified range of a house for sale that meets predefined  criteria, the user would then be notified of the house location and its  details on that same smartphone.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope you like this article...Till nest time...Happy mapping!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"> </div></div>
