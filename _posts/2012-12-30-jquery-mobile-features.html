<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; The always improving and always progressing Jquery Mobile framework is currently in stable version 1.2.0. This version works with&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #f9f9f9;"><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">versions of jQuery core from 1.7.0 to 1.8.2. Let's take a look at the various key features of this very powerful and truly cross-platform mobile web framework.</span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: #f9f9f9;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"></div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><b>Built on Jquery Core - </b>This helps in consistency in syntax as it uses the standard Jquery syntax and makes use of the Jquery UI code and patterns. This also reduces the learning curve to a great extent due to the familiarity with Jquery.</li><li><b style="font-family: inherit;">Compatible with all major mobile, tablet, e-reader &amp; desktop platforms</b><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">- This is probably one of the most important feature of this web platform. Jquery Mobile is compatible with a wide range of devices like iOS, Android, Blackberry, Palm WebOS, Nokia/Symbian, Windows Phone 7, MeeGo, Opera Mobile/Mini, Firefox Mobile, Kindle, Nook and all modern browsers with graded levels of support.</span></li><li><b style="font-family: inherit;">Progressive enhancement</b><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">approach brings core content and functionality to all mobile, tablet and desktop platforms and a rich, installed application-like experience on newer mobile platforms.</span></li><li><b style="font-family: inherit;">Responsive design</b><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">techniques and tools allow the same underlying codebase to automatically scale from smartphone to desktop-sized screens. This is very useful we have the same design for all device sizes like phones and tablets.</span></li><li><b style="font-family: inherit;">Touch and mouse event support</b><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">streamline the process of supporting touch, mouse and cursor focus-based user input methods with a simple API.</span></li><li><b style="font-family: inherit;">Unified UI widgets</b><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">for common controls enhance native controls with touch-optimized, themable controls that are platform-agnostic and easy to use.</span></li><li><b style="font-family: inherit;">HTML5 Markup-driven configuration</b><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">of pages and behavior for fast development and minimal required scripting.</span></li><li><b style="font-family: inherit;">Powerful Ajax-powered navigation system</b><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">to enable animated page transitions while maintaining back button, bookmarking and clean URLs through pushState. This feature comes in handy when the user has to bookmark pages on an e-commerce site or any other site for that matter. We as developers do not have to take extra efforts for bookmarking and back button functionality.</span></li><li><b style="font-family: inherit;">Lightweight size</b><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">and minimal image dependencies for speed. This proves really helpful as Jquery Mobile is used for devices which have a lesser computing speed as compared to our desktops and laptops.</span></li><li><b style="font-family: inherit;">Modular architecture</b><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">for creating custom builds that are optimized to only include the features needed for a particular application. This allows the application to be reduced in size even further.</span></li><li><b style="font-family: inherit;">Accessibility</b><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">features such as WAI-ARIA are also included to ensure that the pages work for screen readers (e.g. VoiceOver in iOS) and other assistive technologies.</span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 18px;"><b>WAI-ARIA, the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite</b>, defines a way to make Web content and Web applications more accessible to people with disabilities - users who rely on Screen Reders or users who cannot use the mouse. It especially helps with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.</span></span></li></ol><div><span style="line-height: 18px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; With all these features provided by the Jquery Mobile framework, the developers have a very strong platform on which they can build extensively branding based, customized and uniform applications across all devices and browsers.</span></div></div>
