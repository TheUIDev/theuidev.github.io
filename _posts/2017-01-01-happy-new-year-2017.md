As the last working day of 2016 came to an end last Friday, the office floors wore a deserted look and every heart filled with the spirit of the new year was making plans to welcome the new year! This is the time, when everyone sits back, takes a break from all their routine work and looks forward to a new opportunity, a new day and new year of learning.

Today on the first day of this new year 2017, I wish everyone a very happy and a prosperous new year! Love more, learn more! Be safe, be happy!
