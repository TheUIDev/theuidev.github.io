<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can now check the traffic condition on the road before you leave for work, or a party or to your friend's place. Google's Traffic layer shows the traffic conditions in your area - LIVE!!! Live traffic data is available in major cities in the United States, France, Britain, Canada and Australia, with new cities and countries frequently added. The Google Maps API allows you to add real-time traffic information (where supported) to your maps using the TrafficLayer object. Traffic information is provided for the time at which the request is made. Consult <a href="http://gmaps-samples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mapcoverage_filtered.html">this spreadsheet</a> to determine traffic coverage support.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us now have a look at the Google Maps API - Trafiic Layer example. Copy the following code in a simple text file and save it as html. Click on this html file and it will open in your default browser. You will then see the traffic conditions in your area - LIVE...<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/75uDq/embedded/" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></iframe><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The output of the above code looks as seen in the result section above. The map in this example is centred at Los Angeles. Traffic Layer data in not available for India as of now. Hope it will be some day soon...</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp; </div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>Traffic Color Description:</b></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b> </b></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>If available in your area, real-time traffic conditions will be displayed over the road as color-coded lines. The colors indicate the speed of traffic on the road compared to free-flowing conditions. For highways, the colors roughly equate to:</div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="color: #38761d;">Green</span>: more than 50 mph or 80 kph.</li><li><span style="color: yellow;">Yellow</span>: 25-50 mph or 40-80 kph.</li><li><span style="color: red;">Red</span>: less than 25 mph or 40 kph.</li><li><span style="color: red;">Red</span>/Black: very slow, stop-and-go traffic.</li><li><span style="color: #666666;">Gray</span>: No data currently available.</li></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These speeds don't apply to traffic on smaller roads, such as those within cities, which have lower speed limits. For roads smaller than highways, the colors give an indication of the severity of the traffic. <span style="color: #38761d;">Green</span> means that the traffic conditions are good, <span style="color: yellow;">yellow</span> means fair, and <span style="color: red;">red</span> or <span style="color: red;">red</span>/black means poor traffic conditions.</div>
