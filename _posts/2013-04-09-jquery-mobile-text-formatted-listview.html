<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; &nbsp; "The regular listview looks plain. I want to add a few other details in my list item." Have you also faced this requirement from your client? Well, for those who have and also for those who haven't yet, you can keep in mind that you can create a text formatted listview using JQM and design accordingly for your next project.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Let's take a look at the following example to understand how text-formatting can be achieved&nbsp;seamlessly.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/Sukd7/1/embedded/result,html,css,resources" width="100%"></iframe><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As you can see in the HTML code above, to add text hierarchy, you need to use headings to increase font emphasis and use paragraphs to reduce the font emphasis.<span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: #f9f9f9; font-family: inherit;">Supplemental information like "</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">Last update: April 9, 2013</span><span style="background-color: #f9f9f9;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">" can be added to the right of each list item by wrapping content in an element like 'div' or 'p' with a of class ui-li-aside.</span></span><br /><span style="background-color: #f9f9f9;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></span><span style="background-color: #f9f9f9;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Now let's take a look at the CSS part. You will notice that I have included some CSS on id "</span></span>no-ellipsis". If you have noticed, in the first list item, the description has been truncated and ellipsis (...) have been added at the end of line. This is the default&nbsp;behavior&nbsp;of JQM framework. However, you can over-ride this and display the complete description as you can observe in the second list item.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Hope you have followed the code sample. In case you have any doubts regarding this code sample, feel free to drop a comment and I would be happy to help.
