The information content has been built on the basis of satellite image  interpretation, survey at the block level and maps of other departments  and agencies. The web atlas contains information on natural resources like land,  utilization distribution of wastelands, forest lands, agriculture area,  plantation, settlement, waterbodies etc.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also contains information on soil, slope, lithology, drainage, geomorphology, ground water potential, said an official. All the administrative bouridaries like state, block, GP, village,  Assembly Constituencies, Parliament Constituency, Watershed, RF/PF  boundary are available in the website. It also contains demographic and beneficiary information of each  village, information on infrastructure like canal, road, rail network  distribution, health and educational facilities, locational information  on drinking water wells, banks, markets and telecommunication.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most important aspect of Orissa Sampad is providing development related data to the common public. The people can know about the development activities completed and continuing in their village from the website. It will also help in proper planning of proposed development activities at village/GP level.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The datasets can be viewed by the public from ORSAC website <a href="http://www.orsac.org/">www.orsac.org</a> or from <a href="http://www.odishasampad.in/">www.odishasampad.in</a>.
