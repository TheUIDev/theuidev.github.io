<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can anybody imagine life in Mumbai without the red BEST bus or the crowded local trains? It is difficult to imagine "aamchi Mumbai" without these buses and locals.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing that life in Mumbai revolves around these trains and buses, Google India has made information on Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) Bus routes and Mumbai local train routes and schedule available on Google Maps. This information will now be available both on desktop and on mobile for millions of commuters in Mumbai, arguably the most used public transportation network in India.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The easy access of this service will help commuters and tourists find their way seamlessly around the city using both trains and buses.</div>
