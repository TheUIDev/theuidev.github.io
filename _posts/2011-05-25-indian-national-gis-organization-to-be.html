<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A specialized institution, Indian National GIS Organization, will be set up, probably within a year, to provide an independent view on progress of existing projects and the need for new projects. The idea of having a central GIS body consisting of nation-wide GIS  assets and application services to provide inputs for better decision  making was floated by the Plan panel, which has set up a committee of experts headed by secretary of earth sciences ministry, Shailesh  Nayak, to prepare the framework of National GIS body to be set up in a  public-private partnership mode.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The body will help ministries such as environment, water resources,  urban &amp; rural development to integrate satellite- based technology  with the infrastructure creation process. The GIS inputs will be valuable for long-term planning and will provide real time insight to the Centre before taking a decision.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decision of setting up such an organization has been taken after observing that some projects have gone really slow and some have even been lacking the right vision and data requirement. The setting up the National GIS organization would definitely go a long way in the development of the country.</div></div>
