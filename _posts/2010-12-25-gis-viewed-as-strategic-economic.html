<div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Asia Pacific region is in the midst of rapid change. This change   depends on information. Much of this information is concerned with   questions that are fundamentally geographic in orientation -- such as   the spatial patterns of households or businesses, and proposed   infrastructure facilities within a community.&nbsp;The role of geographic  information in economic development  dominated the proceedings of the  second ESRI Asia Pacific user group  meeting earlier this year. The  meeting was hosted by NIIT Technologies.  It drew more than 1100  delegates from across the region to New Delhi for  two days of  discussion.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meeting was held at the right time. Historically, India has   enjoyed a reputation for capable data conversion. But now, Indians are   creating centres of excellence for GIS project development.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">Dave Byers, ESRI's Asia Pacific regional manager, told the  meeting  that there was a clear trend of increased GIS deployment on the   internet. This, he said, helps facilitate the dissemination and exchange   of spatial information.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ESRI's chief executive Jack Dangermond echoed these comments.  He  said: 'as in many other technical fields, the Asia Pacific region is   exploding in its application and implementation of GIS as a platform   technology. 'ESRI India alone last year recorded a 60 per cent growth. Similar stories exist in China, Australia, and Thailand.'</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rajendra S Pawar, the chair of NIICT Technologies said: 'The   proliferation and spread of GIS has taken on the flavour of a quiet   revolution. The movement is gradually gaining momentum within leading   corporations and government agencies. GIS is becoming part of the normal   workflow of many industries.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">'For example, the Reliance Group, one of the leading companies  in  India, is using GIS across many of its operations. Once its GIS is   fully implemented, Reliance will have a total end to end GIS-centric   solution.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The region is developing a reputation for exporting its GIS   services and for application development. There is also an increasing   domestic demand to support the database development and implementation   within the Asian Pacific countries', he said.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The Survey of India alone has national coverage at 1:250,000,   1:50,000, and 1:25,000 in a completely digital environment. India's   Ministry of Science and Technology has indicated that the national   coverage will be expanded to include 1:10,000, 1:5,000, and 1:2,000 in   all of the country's major metropolitan areas.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This type of commitment to spatial data infrastructure  reflects the  vision of a national government that understands the  importance and  application of this data.'</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">Source: <a href="http://www.asmmag.com/features/feature/gis-viewed-as-strategic-economic-development-tool-1605302">Asian Surveying and Mapping</a></div>
