<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; &nbsp; Continuing with the Jquery Mobile Examples, today we will take a look at the listviews in Jquery Mobile. Listviews are popularly used in websites and web-applications that are built on the Jquery Mobile platform and hence we will look at the various list patterns available with Jquery Mobile. Lists are used for a various purposes like data display, navigation, result lists and data entry. We will start with the most basic listview example and look through several examples over a number of posts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A listview is simply an unordered list containing linked list items with a <code> data-role="listview"</code> attribute. jQuery Mobile will apply all the necessary styles to transform the list  into a mobile-friendly listview with right arrow indicator that fills  the full width of the browser window. When you tap on the list item, the  framework will trigger a click on the first link inside the list item,  issue an Ajax request for the URL in the link, create the new page in  the DOM, then kick off a page transition.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Let's take a look at the example that follows:<br /><br /><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/QRgMh/2/embedded/result,html,resources/" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></iframe><br /></span></tt><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The jQuery Mobile listview appears as seen in the result section in the example above. As you can see in the result, the list stretches to 100% width with straight corners and sharp edges. If you need to get the rounded corners to your lists you need to include the <code>data-inset="true" </code>property on the unordered-list. We will take a look at this in the post <a href="http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.in/2013/02/jquery-mobile-listview-with-data-inset.html" target="_blank">here</a> which discusses the jQuery Mobile list view with data-inset property.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope you have followed the post and do let me know in case you need to know anything more on this article. Your critics and suggestions are always welcome.
