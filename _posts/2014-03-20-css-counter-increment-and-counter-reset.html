<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Today we will take a look at a couple of CSS properties that are usually used together but not very frequently used. We will be talking about the <b>counter-increment</b> and <b>counter-reset</b> properties.<br /><br />As the name suggests counter-increment and counter-reset definitely have something to do with counters. Let's take a look at the example below which will clearly illustrate the usage of these 2 properties.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/Ayxvp/embedded/css,html,result/" width="100%"></iframe><br /><br />The implementation is very clear and straight-forward. The only question that remains now, can these CSS properties replace the ordered list (ol-li) HTML code? Do let me know your comments and feedback. Would you use these CSS properties against the standard ol-li structure?</div>
