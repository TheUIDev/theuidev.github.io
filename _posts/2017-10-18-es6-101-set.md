This is going to be the 10th post in the ES6 101 series and the topic for today is ```Set```. ```Set``` object is a collection of values and is iterable. One cool thing about the values in set is that these are **unique**. This means that a set can have a value only once. Moreover you can think of a set as an actualy set in Mathematics. We will see a few samples to understand this concept of ```set```.

## Examples of ES6 ```Set```
### Creating a new set and adding values to it.
Let's create  a new set and add some values to it and then discuss it further.
```javascript
    let dummySet = new Set(); // That's it! A new set object is created

    dummySet.add(1);
    console.log(dummySet); // [1]

    dummySet.add(1);
    console.log(dummySet); // [1] and not [1,1]. This is because, values in a set are unique.

    dummySet.add(2).add(3).add(4);
    console.log(dummySet); // [1,2,3,4]

    dummySet.add('The UnderTaker').add('John Cena');
    console.log(dummySet); // [1,2,3,4,'The UnderTaker',''John Cena]
    // Yes. I am a WWE fan...

    dummySet.add({"someKey": "someValue"})
    console.log(dummySet); // [1,2,3,4,'The UnderTaker','John Cena', {"someKey": "someValue"}]

    console.log(dummySet.size) // 7

    console.log(dummySet.has('John Cena')); // true

    console.log(dummySet.has(7)); // false

    for (let item of dummySet) {
        console.log(item); // All the values in the set are consoled.
    }
```
Pretty straight forward! I know ES6 is cool. Nothing complex &#128526;. There are a few things to note in the sample above.
1. ```Set``` has unique values. Even if you add the same value twice or more, you will get it only once.
2. ```Set``` can contain different types of values.
3. ```Set``` is iterable as demonstarted by the for..of loop. In case you don't know how the for..of works, you can head over to the [post](http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.com/2017/10/es6-101-forof.html) which discusses that.

That's it! This is what ```Set``` does in ES6. We could conclude the post here, but in the begining of the post I mentioned that this ```Set``` is quivalent to its mathematical counterpart, so let's take a look at what that is.

Sets in mathematics have a few very popular operations like Union, Intersection and Complement. To help you jolt your memory and save you a Google search, here are the Venn diagrams that depit these 3 operations.

### Implementing the mathematical set operations using ES6 ```Set```
Let's see how we can implement these mathematical operations using ES6 ```Set```. &#128525;
```javascript
    let setA = new Set([1,2,3]);
    let setB = new Set([2,3,4,5]);
    let setC = new Set([1,2]);

    // Find if a set is a super set of another
    Set.prototype.isSuperset = function (subset) {
        for (let item of subset) {
            if (!this.has(item)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    console.log(setA.isSuperset(setC)) // true
    console.log(setA.isSuperset(setB)) // false Obviously! As all values of setB are not contained in setA

    // Find the union of 2 sets.
    Set.prototype.union = function(setTwo){
        let setD = new Set(this);
        for(let item of setTwo){
            if(!this.has(item)){
                setD.add(item)
            }
        }
        return setD;
    }
    console.log(setA.union(setB)); // [1,2,3,4,5]
    console.log(setA.union(setC)); // [1,2,3]

    // Find the intersection between 2 sets.
    Set.prototype.intersect = function(setTwo){
        let setD = new Set();
        for(let item of setTwo){
            if(this.has(item)){
                setD.add(item);
            }
        }
        return setD;
    }
    console.log(setA.intersect(setB)); // [2,3]
    console.log(setA.intersect(setC)); // [1,2]

    // Find the complement of a set
    Set.prototype.complement = function(setTwo){
        let setD = new Set();
        for(let item of setTwo){
            if(!this.has(item)){
                setD.add(item);
            }
        }
        return setD;
    }
    console.log(setA.complement(setB)); // [4,5]
    console.log(setA.complement(setC)); // []
```
This above example demonstartes what we can achieve with ES6 ```Set```. Hope this helps you understand the capabilities of this powerful feature. Let me know what you think of it and how you are using it in your real world code! Until next post in the series, you can browse through the other features that we have discussed so far.
