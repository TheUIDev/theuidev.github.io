&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having seen what GIS is, we will now have a look at what GPS or the Global Positioning System is! Wikipedia's following GPS definition says it all. "The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based global navigation satellite system (GNSS) that provides reliable location  and time information in all weather and at all times and anywhere on or  near the Earth when and where there is an unobstructed line of sight to  four or more GPS satellites."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation                  system made up of a network of 24 satellites placed into orbit                  by the U.S. Department of Defense. The 24 satellites are orbiting                 the earth about 12,000 miles above us. They are constantly moving,                 making two complete orbits in less than 24 hours. These satellites               are travelling at speeds of roughly 7,000 miles an hour.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GPS satellites are powered by solar energy. They have backup                   batteries onboard to keep them running in the event of a solar                   eclipse,                   when there's no solar power. Small rocket boosters on each                 satellite keep them flying in the correct path.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are some other interesting facts about the GPS satellites                     (also called NAVSTAR, the official U.S. Department of Defense                     name for GPS):<br /><ul><li>The first GPS satellite was launched in 1978. </li></ul><ul><li>A full constellation of 24 satellites was achieved in 1994. </li></ul><ul><li>Each satellite is built to last about 10 years. Replacements                    are constantly being built and launched into orbit. </li></ul><ul><li>A GPS satellite weighs approximately 2,000 pounds and is about                    17 feet across with the solar panels extended. </li></ul><ul><li>Transmitter power is only 50 watts or less.</li></ul><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_qeXtpMh3bHg/TPD7CXpGAQI/AAAAAAAAAVk/VPGmyKbWHEE/s1600/24satellite.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_qeXtpMh3bHg/TPD7CXpGAQI/AAAAAAAAAVk/VPGmyKbWHEE/s1600/24satellite.jpg" /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GPS satellites circle the earth twice a day in a very precise                  orbit and transmit signal information to earth. GPS receivers                  take this information and use triangulation to calculate the user's                  exact location. Essentially, the GPS receiver compares the time                  a signal was transmitted by a satellite with the time it was received.                  The time difference tells the GPS receiver how far away the satellite                  is. Now, with distance measurements from a few more satellites,                  the receiver can determine the user's position and display it                  on the unit's electronic map.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A GPS receiver must be locked on to the signal of at least three                  satellites to calculate a 2D position (latitude and longitude)                  and track movement. With four or more satellites in view, the                  receiver can determine the user's 3D position (latitude, longitude                  and altitude). Once the user's position has been determined, the                  GPS unit can calculate other information, such as speed, bearing,                  track, trip distance, distance to destination, sunrise and sunset                  time and more.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_qeXtpMh3bHg/TPD7xmPjxLI/AAAAAAAAAVo/rDpwSTqtCCw/s1600/images.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_qeXtpMh3bHg/TPD7xmPjxLI/AAAAAAAAAVo/rDpwSTqtCCw/s1600/images.jpg" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's GPS receivers are extremely accurate. Today GPS receivers are embedded in a large number of phones. Day-by-day, knowingly or un-knowingly the common man is getting more and more exposure to GIS and GPS technology based systems.
