<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have seen a number of examples for markers and info-windows. We can definitely move ahead now with other things in Google Maps API v3. Today we will have a look at polylines. Today's example will show a hard-coded polyline, but later on we will have a look at creating polylines on the fly. We will also create polygons and calculate the geographic area and more but at a later stage!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us now first have a look at today's polyline code. You just need to copy and paste the code that follows into a text file and save it as .html. Double-click on the file and you will be able to see the map in action.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/E45Su/embedded/" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></iframe><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The output of the above code looks as seen in the result section above! The code is very simple and does not require any special explanation I guess! We have made use of an array to store the co-ordinates that form the polyline on the map! Rest is mostly as usual!<br /><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please feel free to drop me a line about the code or the blog in general!
