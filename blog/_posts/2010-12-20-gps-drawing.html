&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Digital mark making with satellite navigation technology" is how you can define GPS Drawing Project!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Jeremy Wood</strong> is a multi-discipline artist and map maker whose diverse work is an expression of the poetry and politics of space  and reflects upon how we treat our travels and interact with location. In October 2000 he began to explore GPS satellite technology as a tool  for digital mark making on water, over land, and in the air. He makes drawings and maps of his movements and records all his daily journeys with GPS as an ongoing personal cartography.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Wood has conducted numerous GPS drawing and mapping seminars and workshops in schools, museums and galleries. His work is exhibited internationally and is in the permanent collection  of the University of the Arts and the Victoria and Albert Museum in  London.
