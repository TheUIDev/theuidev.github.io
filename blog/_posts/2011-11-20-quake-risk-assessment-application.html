<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="body" style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A GIS application has been designed to help the Chennai  Corporation and the departments concerned to take quick decisions when a  major earthquake strikes the city. The application  has been prepared based on data collected as part of the seismic  vulnerability screening of over 50,000 buildings with more than three  floors by the civic body in association with the Centre for Disaster  Mitigation and Management, Anna University. However, buildings in the defence areas were not covered in the seismic vulnerability screening.</div><div class="body" style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div class="body" style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  civic body has started taking measures towards providing the GIS  application to other agencies such as Fire and Rescue Services, Police  and Home Guards. The GIS application could be used  to find out if any of the residential or commercial buildings with three  of more storeys are safe when an earthquake strikes. The number of buildings that are likely to be damaged with a particular magnitude of earthquake in the city could be estimated.</div><div class="body" style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div class="body" style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As  soon as an earthquake with a certain magnitude is recorded in the city,  the officials of the civic body would be able to trace the buildings  that could have got damaged using the GIS application. The  safe escape route of the injured residents of the damaged building to  the nearest hospital would also be mapped with the help of the GIS  application and the authorities at the ward level would take action at  the quickest possible time. The application would  also be used to make a decision on the establishment of relief centres  by locating strong earthquake-resistant structures in each of the 155  wards of the Corporation.</div><div class="body" style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div class="body" style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The civic body is likely to  take a decision shortly on permitting the public too to make use of the  GIS application for better disaster preparedness. This could help those purchasing an apartment in a multi-storeyed residential building make an informed decision.</div><div class="body" style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </div><div class="body" style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More and more such applications of Risk Assessment using GIS should be implement throughout the states in India, as India faces the risks from natural catastrophes like floods, earthquakes and tsunamis. These applications will definitely help the government and also the people of the country in making wise decisions while buying property, land, etc.</div><div class="body" style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"> </div></div>
