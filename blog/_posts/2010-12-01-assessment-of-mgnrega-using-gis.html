&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for Rural Development Shri Pradeep Jain “Aditya” informed the Rajya Sabhaon November 30, 2010 that It is proposed to use Geographical Information System (GIS) under  Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). In  this regard, Ministry of Rural Development has set up an Expert Group to  prepare a strategy for nationwide rollout and to evolve parameters for  standardization with an objective to link GIS with grass root  participatory planning and asset management and monitoring.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Replying to a written question the minister said use of GIS will  strengthen decentralized participatory planning, implementation,  capturing and monitoring of assets and evaluation of the works  under&nbsp;MGNREGA and also this move will help the Ministry to bring in  greater transparency and accountability in the implementation of the  Scheme as real time data would be available.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This news clearly shows that India is slowly and steadily promoting the use and spread of GIS!
