<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; &nbsp; We have been taking a look at several <a href="http://www.blogger.com/"><span id="goog_1679522291"></span>Jquery Mobile examples<span id="goog_1679522292"></span></a> here and the the Jquery Mobile version that we were using was 1.2.0. The next stable version was 1.3.1 and included a few new features. I will be covering all the features of Jquery Mobile 1.3.1 in the presentation here and also other topics like:<br /><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Design constraints that we need to consider while developing our next mobile website or application</li><li>Different ways in which we can effectively debug our mobile website or web application from our desktop or using remote-debugging on the iOS and Android platforms.</li></ul><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Take a look at the presentation below and you can redirect any queries to me here or tweet me&nbsp;@shreerangp or drop me a line on G+&nbsp;<a class="g-profile" href="http://plus.google.com/104889409165891702612" target="_blank">+Shreerang Patwardhan</a>. Hope you enjoy the presentation and also all the code samples that I have included as part of the presentation.</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; The next stable release for Jquery Mobile would be 1.4.x. Once the Jquery Mobile team makes a release, I will put together a presentation that will talk about all the features of that version.</div><br /><br /><iframe frameborder="0" height="400" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/28773935" width="660"></iframe></div>
