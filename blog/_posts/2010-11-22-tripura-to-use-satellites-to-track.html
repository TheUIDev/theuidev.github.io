&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tripura will soon use satellites to track terrorists in the state,  director general of police K. Saleem Ali said on Sunday the 14th of November, 2010 adding that the  state's three-decade old militancy will be "flushed out within the next  few months". Tripura would be the third state in India, after Jammu and Kashmir and Jharkhand, to introduce the Geo Satellite Imagery Systems (GSIS) for curbing militancy.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The satellite image would be as clear as if taken from 10 feet above  the ground. All district police chiefs would operate this new system to  locate the activities of the separatist outfits. All the police stations of the state are being connected electronically for better coordination. In the first phase 22 out of the 66 police stations would be linked!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new method to register a FIR through SMS will also be introduced and would commence from January next year with the help of the National Informatic Center.<br /><br />Source: <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/tripura/Tripura-to-use-satellites-to-track-terrorists/Article1-626091.aspx">Hindustan Times</a>
