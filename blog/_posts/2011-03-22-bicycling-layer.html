<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recreational cyclists and bike commuters alike can plot cycle-friendly routes, find trails, and avoid snarling traffic with Google Map's Bicycle layer. Map's bike-friendly, green-toned map layer is very eye-pleasing. The Google Maps API allows you to add bicycle information to your maps using the BicyclingLayer object.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The BicyclingLayer renders a layer of bike paths, suggested bike routes and other overlays specific to bicycling usage on top of the given map. Additionally, the layer alters the style of the base map itself to emphasize streets supporting bicycle routes and de-emphasize streets inappropriate for bicycles.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us have a look at the following example. The code has a map which is centered at Pune, India. There are very few cycle tracks in Pune and so you will see just a few dark green lines on the map. But if you would change the latitude-longitude values in the code and center the map at USA, then you will see a full-blown bicycling layer.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/9VzMa/embedded/" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></iframe><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The output of the above code will look as seen in the result section above. <span style="color: #38761d;">Dark green</span> routes indicate dedicated bicycle routes. <span style="color: lime;">Light green</span> routes indicate streets with dedicated "bike lanes". Dashed routes indicate streets or paths otherwise recommended for bicycle usage.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have any queries or doubts regarding the above code do drop a comment. Till then happy mapping!...:)</div></div>
