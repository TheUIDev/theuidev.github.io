On the 17th of November, 2010, the world will celebrate "GIS Day". GIS day is held each year in the third week of November, on the Wednesday during the Geography Awareness Week, a geographic literacy initiative sponsored by the National Geographic Society.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GIS Day is playing a powerful role in creating geographic awareness throughout our world. GIS Day provides an international forum for users of geographic  information systems (GIS) technology to demonstrate real-world  applications that are making a difference in our society.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than 80 countries will participate in holding local events such as  corporate open houses, hands-on workshops, community expos, school  assemblies, and more. Any organisation that uses GIS can participate in this global event.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Large or small, there are many ways you can participate. From showing a  few co-workers what GIS does for your organisation to citywide school  presentations, everyone can host a GIS Day event. You can <a href="http://www.gisday.com/events/register.html">register</a> your event with the GIS Day organisers. You can find more information about the events happening in India on GIS Day <a href="http://www.gisday.com/apps/search1.cfm">here</a>. You can follow the happenings of GIS Day on Facebook as well. Search for "GIS Day". There is lot more on their <a href="http://www.gisday.com/index.html">website</a>.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said all this, it's sad that Pune does not have any registered GIS Day event! I just hope somebody reads this blog and arranges an open-to-all GIS Day event. Wish you all a happy GIS Day in advance!
