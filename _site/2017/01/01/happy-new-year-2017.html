<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the last working day of 2016 came to an end last Friday, the office floors wore a deserted look and &nbsp;every heart filled with the spirit of the new year was making plans to welcome the new year! This is the time, when everyone sits back, takes a break from all their routine work and looks forward to a new opportunity, a new day and new year of learning.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Today on the first day of this new year 2017, I wish everyone a very happy and a prosperous new year! Love more, learn more! Be safe, be happy!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="360" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V-ugS6u8eNY/WGl8o6LaviI/AAAAAAAAORk/NiNubmH5TGQI388l2ov1TQsoH7GZK5LjwCLcB/s640/New_Year_2017.jpg" width="640" /></div><br /></div>
