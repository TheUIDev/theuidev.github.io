A brief interval, the curtains go up and we would be looking forward to the next year - <b>2015</b>! This past year, I wrote comparatively few posts, but some really good ones. Though I have shared a few posts this year round, I have learned new things and techniques this year. I have upgraded my skills and am looking forward to put these to use in the new year and share new things with you all.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; I did a retrospective of what I shared during the last year and the data has revealed the top-shared and read posts over the last year.

It's a new year, new techniques, new skills and a new place. A perfect recipe to share some great techniques and articles with the community. Things are looking bright and I am hoping to write more this year! Hope you all had a great year too and wish you all a very happy new year 2015! Stay tuned for more updates and new things. See you in the new year!</div><div><br /></div></div>
