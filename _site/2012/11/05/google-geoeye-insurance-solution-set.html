<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google will now soon be entering the market of risk management and crisis event response. With the extent of satellite imagery and the extent of geospatial expertise available with Google, this was an obvious thing coming. People, especially from the insurance industry, have long being pondering on the fact, that why Google had not moved into the the Catastrophic Risk Management avenue before. But now, the wait is over and Google is soon stepping into the Risk management domain that may bring a stir in the market dominated by companies like <a href="http://www.rms.com/">RMS</a> and <a href="http://www.air-worldwide.com/Home/AIR-Worldwide/">AIR</a>.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google is teaming with <a href="http://www.geoeye.com/CorpSite/">GeoEye</a> to help insurance organizations across the globe, more  effectively address risk management and crisis event response. &nbsp;Google’s  mapping solutions, combined with GeoEye’s Earth imagery and geospatial  expertise, provide a platform for enabling strategic decision making,  optimization of people and assets, and powerful location-based  applications across the enterprise. Insurers know that having an accurate understanding of an asset’s  location and associated risks (natural disaster potential, crime, lack  of fire stations, high replacement costs, etc.) is critical to  evaluating risk in the underwriting process.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Having such kind of accurate location based understanding of the risks associated with the insured locations becomes all the more important in the aftermath of a crisis event when claims get filed. It helps to have an accurate view of the affected areas over time and geography.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Google and GeoEye have developed the solution set to address these scenarios. Google had GeoEye, together hosted a webinar just recently, where Google’s Hillary Renderman and GeoEye’s Andre Kearns described several use cases, and were joined by Google’s Chris Sierra and  GeoEye’s Alistair Miller, who gave a demo of the solution set.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; The slides of the presentation are as follows:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="356" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/14883058" style="border-width: 1px 1px 0; border: 1px solid #CCC; margin-bottom: 5px;" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" width="620"> </iframe></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Some of the key points from the webinar included:</span><br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">About Google Enterprise that takes  Google's most popular                   and innovative consumer web  services and makes                   them ready for Businesses,  Governments and                   Educational Institutions; aligning the way people work with the way they live.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">Geographic information is mission critical - yet most of it remains silo ed or unused."
