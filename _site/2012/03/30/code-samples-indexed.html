<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering the request from a number of blog readers to index all the code samples on the blog, I have now created a page from where you can refer to all the code samples in a sequential manner. You will be able to see a "<a href="http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.in/p/code-samples.html">Code Samples</a>" tab on the top of every page on the blog from where you can access all the code samples you wish to! The code examples are now <a href="http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.in/2012/04/50000-hits-and-live-examples.html">live</a> and you can actually see the outputs here itself on the blog. No need to copy paste the codes anymore!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope you find this simple page helpful! I would be happy to hear from you all. Please leave your feedback and comments! </div>
