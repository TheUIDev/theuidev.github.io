Just recently, I started working on a project using the Jquery Mobile framework and just instantly fell in love with it! Jquery Mobile gives&nbsp;immense&nbsp;power and flexibility to developers and enables&nbsp;truly&nbsp;cross-platform and cross-browser and multi-device development. I have just loved it and have decided to share my knowledge with the readers of <a href="http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.com/">Spatial Unlimited</a>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8Ih8ZKG6jvw/UNfwrS-ZUEI/AAAAAAAAA8E/CFmoQtfqRZA/s1600/jquery-mobile-logo.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="177" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8Ih8ZKG6jvw/UNfwrS-ZUEI/AAAAAAAAA8E/CFmoQtfqRZA/s400/jquery-mobile-logo.png" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Jquery Mobile is a touch optimized web framework for smartphones and tablets.<span style="background-color: white;">&nbsp;It's a&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 21px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white;">unified, HTML5-based user interface system for all popular mobile device platforms, built on the rock-solid jQuery and jQuery UI foundation. Its lightweight code is built with progressive enhancement, and has a flexible, easily themeable design. This is one reason why I love Jquery Mobile. It is easily customizable - no head-ace of themeing; Jquery Mobile does it for you.</span></span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="line-height: 21px;"><br /></span></span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="line-height: 21px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Instead of writing unique apps for each mobile device or OS, the jQuery mobile framework allows you to design a single highly-branded web site or application that will work on all popular smartphone, tablet, and desktop platforms. This is another reason for the growing popularity of this web framework. Jquery Mobile takes care of all the cross-platform, OS specific issues and is&nbsp;</span></span><span style="line-height: 21px;">continuously improving the support. Jquery Mobile has a very good developer community adding to the fast progress and device support for the same.</span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="line-height: 21px;"><br /></span></span></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="line-height: 21px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Jquery Mobile has a wide range of UI widgets and elements, all following a fluid design, that we will be taking a look at in the following posts. I am on my learning curve and hope to take several along with me and on the way learn a lot from the many web-gurus here. Hope you like this new initiative from Spatial Unlimited and continue to show your support by sharing the knowledge, suggesting things and correcting me if I go wrong anywhere.</span></span></span></div></div>
