<div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the focus of the nation shifting towards infrastructure  development, through national programs like JNRUM, IRDP, and the  participation of private players in infrastructure development, it is  projected that annual investments to the tune of Rs. 1,000 Billion will  be made in the country across the next 5-7 years. The efficacy of  Geoinformatics and Remote Sensing in Infrastructure planning,  development and management is well recognized and promoted by the  Department of Space and other governmental agencies. In this context,  the National Symposium and ISRS Annual Convention is organized on the  topic <b>"GIS AND REMOTE SENSING IN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT"</b> from the 29th of November, 2010 to 4th December, 2010.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  Symposium will expose the frontline developments in remote sensing and  Geoinformatics to the infrastructural developers, enabling the latter to  appreciate the cost-saving and accuracy enabled by the technology. It  is expected that the Symposium will provide a forum for a direct  interaction between the space scientists and Geoinformatics  technologists on one side and infrastructure managers and administrators  on the other.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Indian Society of Remote Sensing, Pune Chapter is hosting the ISRS Annual Convention for the second time after 1996.The Symposium venue is located at the hill station of Lonavala, known as  the "Jewel of the Sahyadris" is famed for the scenic landscape, milky  waterfalls, lush greenery and pleasant cool winds on the slopes of  Sahyadri mountains, straddling the Mumbai-Pune highway; about 50km west  of Pune. Various educational institutions, research and scientific organizations  from government as well as private sector, namely, Sinhgad Educational  Institutes, University of Pune - STP, C-DAC, CWPRS, NWA, Symbiosis  institute of Geomatics and Kalyani group of companies are combinedly hosting  the program.</div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The theme of this symposium is the role of Geoinformatics and Remote sensing in Infrastructure development. The role of Geospatial technology in disaster management, natural resource management, environment and forest, archeology, etc. will also be discussed!</div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: inherit;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For more details about the symposium please visit the ISRS Pune Chapter's <a href="http://www.isrs2010.in/isrs%20pune%20chapter.aspx">website</a>.
