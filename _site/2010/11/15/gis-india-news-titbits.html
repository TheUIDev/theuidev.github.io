This would make the working  transparent and by making information available to the people on  internet.</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State has already set up State  Resource Information Centre that uses space technology for formulation  of development plans and their evaluation and monitoring. Dhumal said AGiSAC  would function as nodal agency for development and planning through  Geo-Informatics and Space Technology. The project would be set up with  the technical support of Government of Gujarat. </span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Apart from the above news there was another interesting news last month. <b>"Indian Railways to install GPS"</b>. According to railway minister Mamta Banerjee, GPS technology will be installed on trains in India in the next two years to avoid accidents. The project, Satellite Imaging for Rail Navigation (Simran), uses satellite imaging software along with the&nbsp; GPS and was developed as part of the Railway Safety Technology Mission to provide correct&nbsp; train information to passengers. Field trial was conducted in several trains, including Rajdhani Express (Mumbai, Howrah and Patna) and Shatabdi Express (Bhopal, Amritsar and Lucknow).</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading these news, I was inclined to believe that the current scenario of GIS is definitely improving! Hope to find many more such news on a regular basis!</span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;">Source for the first news: <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/himachal-to-set-up-geoinformatics-centre-on-the-lines-of-gujarat/709606/0">Indian Express</a></span></div><div style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></div>
