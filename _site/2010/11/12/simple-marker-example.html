<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Once you have set up your map as seen in the earlier <a href="http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.com/2010/11/simple-map-using-google-maps-api-v3.html">post</a> you can now place a marker at your point of interest on the map. A marker is a symbol that is used to point something interesting or important on the map! A marker can be overlayed on a map statically, dynamically i.e. when a user clicks on a map, a marker appears on the map. Markers can also be loaded from an XML file, a plain text file and also a CSV file. We will be seeing an example of each in the subsequent posts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later on we will also see how to add an information window to the markers on the map! But that will be at a later stage. Let us have a look at the following code first which will add a marker at the Rajya Sabha, New Delhi.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/dUMFW/1/embedded/" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></iframe></div><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And here you are...You have placed a marker at your point of interest. The output will look as seen in the result section above. Feel free to change the point of interest and see a marker at a location of your choice. Happy mapping!<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div></div>
