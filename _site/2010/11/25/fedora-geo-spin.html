&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's here! An GIS oriented Operating System!...Currently under development with a target release as Fedora 15, Fedora Geo Spin is a collection of mapping tools that run on Fedora. This includes tools for map making, integration into OpenStreetMap, and components that can be run on a GPS enabled device.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; This spin will include map making tools that integrate with  OpenStreetMap. This will enable map makers to use Fedora as a platform  for cartography.The end goal is an ISO and kickstart that can be depolyed to work with most cartography setups.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Integration with developer tools for developing other programs  that work with GPS devices. This may lead to a developer subspin that  integrates development libraries and tools including for GPS devices. This probably includes a group in comps for handling Geo related libraries and the development counterparts.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; This Geo spin can be integrated with MIDs and other devices that can be enabled with a GPS, to cater to hobbyists such as geocachers, as well as providing a fully open source GPS navigation solution.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can have a look at the actual contents of the spin with details about the packages and stuff at the Fedora <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/GIS">wiki</a>. Such an initiative from Fedora clearly goes to show that GIS is evolving day by day and there will be a day when GIS will be "the" domain to be in!
