<div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Geocaching is a high-tech treasure hunting game played throughout the  world by adventure seekers equipped with GPS devices. The basic idea is  to locate hidden containers, called geocaches, outdoors and then share  your experiences online. Geocaching is enjoyed by people from all age  groups, with a strong sense of community and support for the environment. The following video has been taken from "Geocaching - The official global GPS Cache Hunt Site". This site will give you a brief idea of what Geocaching exactly is!</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOG_video_class" id="BLOG_video-50b226ce09316e22" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube.com/get_player"><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"><param name="flashvars" value="flvurl=https://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?requiressl%3Dyes%26id%3D50b226ce09316e22%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsecure_transport%253Dyes%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1511646345%26sparams%3Drequiressl,id,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D8C12D9A54E2FF5F3A33B092BED25855DC6133165.8BAFF2A7F516E0F80B7A2FF47ED35A96D71495E7%26key%3Dck2&amp;iurl=https://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3D50b226ce09316e22%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DtTj8fxbkZ3U2wJVZ_0r-VBQ-pYk&amp;autoplay=0&amp;ps=blogger"><embed src="//www.youtube.com/get_player" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="320" height="266" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" flashvars="flvurl=https://redirector.googlevideo.com/videoplayback?requiressl%3Dyes%26id%3D50b226ce09316e22%26itag%3D5%26source%3Dblogger%26app%3Dblogger%26cmo%3Dsecure_transport%253Dyes%26cmo%3Dsensitive_content%253Dyes%26ip%3D0.0.0.0%26ipbits%3D0%26expire%3D1511646345%26sparams%3Drequiressl,id,itag,source,ip,ipbits,expire%26signature%3D8C12D9A54E2FF5F3A33B092BED25855DC6133165.8BAFF2A7F516E0F80B7A2FF47ED35A96D71495E7%26key%3Dck2&iurl=https://video.google.com/ThumbnailServer2?app%3Dblogger%26contentid%3D50b226ce09316e22%26offsetms%3D5000%26itag%3Dw160%26sigh%3DtTj8fxbkZ3U2wJVZ_0r-VBQ-pYk&autoplay=0&ps=blogger" allowFullScreen="true" /></object></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 2, 2000, at approximately midnight, eastern savings time, the great blue switch* controlling selective availability was pressed. Twenty-four satellites around the globe processed their  new orders, and instantly the accuracy of GPS technology improved  tenfold. Tens of thousands of GPS receivers around the world had an  instant upgrade.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The announcement a day before came as a welcome surprise to  everyone who worked with GPS technology. The government had planned to  remove selective availability - but had until 2006 to do so. Now, said  the White House, anyone could "precisely pinpoint their location or the  location of items (such as game) left behind for later recovery." How  right they were.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 3, one such enthusiast, Dave Ulmer, a computer consultant,  wanted to test the accuracy by hiding a navigational target in the  woods. He called the idea the "Great American GPS Stash Hunt" and posted  it in an internet GPS users' group. The idea was simple: Hide a  container out in the woods and note the coordinates with a GPS unit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The finder would then have to locate the container with only  the use of his or her GPS receiver. The rules for the finder were  simple: "Take some stuff, leave some stuff."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 3rd he placed his own container, a black bucket, in  the woods near Beavercreek, Oregon, near Portland. Along with a logbook  and pencil, he left various prize items including videos, books,  software, and a slingshot. He shared the waypoint of his "stash" with  the online community on sci.geo.satellite-nav:<br /><div style="text-align: center;">N 45° 17.460 W 122° 24.800</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within three days, two different readers read about his stash  on the Internet, used their own GPS receivers to find the container,  and shared their experiences online. Throughout the next week, others  excited by the prospect of hiding and finding stashes began hiding their  own containers and posting coordinates. Like many new and innovative  ideas on the Internet, the concept spread quickly - but this one  required <i>leaving your computer</i> to participate.<br />Within the first month, Mike Teague, the first person to find  Ulmer's stash, began gathering the online posts of coordinates around  the world and documenting them on his personal home page. The "GPS Stash  Hunt" mailing list was created to discuss the emerging activity. Names  were even tossed about to replace the name "stash" due to the negative  connotations of that name. One such name was "geocaching."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can subscribe to Geocaching.com membership which is free and requires only a valid email address and your name to create an account.
