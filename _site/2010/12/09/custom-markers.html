<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have now seen numerous examples of markers and info-windows in Google Maps API v3. We will now see a last example where-in we will replace the customary marker icon with an icon of our choice! In the example that follows, I have shown 5 beaches in Goa along the Konkan coastal strip! These are nothing but markers, just with a different icon! Lets have a look at the following code!<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/kEcgc/embedded/" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></iframe><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The output of the above code looks as seen in the result section above. This is a simple code that goes here! If you have any queries or doubts or suggestions regarding this example you can comment on the same or feel free to drop me a <a href="mailto:patwardhan.shreerang@gmail.com">mail</a>! In the meantime...Happy Mapping! </div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div></div>
