&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has for the last two  years, been in the process of conducting a massive exercise to map the  13.87 lakh properties in the 198 wards in the city. Geographical  Information System (GIS) has proven to be an effective tool for  analysing and displaying thematic maps of all the roads for proper  evaluation and correction of zones.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of now, 11 lakh properties have come under the tax net. The aim of  this programme, which is perhaps the first such exercise being conducted  in the country on such a large scale, covering 800 square km, is to  bring all properties under the tax net and ensure that the BBMP has  accurate information pertaining to the properties’ dimension, built-up  area, land use and classification. The process of validation of GIS  maps will be completed in January 2011.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The process uses satellite digital maps of the BBMP area to generate a  vector map from the information obtained. These high resolution  satellite images are then used to extract details of roads, plots and  buildings. However, the challenge will be to tag properties in zones that do not  have an orderly maintenance of records, and to demarcate tank bunds,  government lands and slums. The old BMP area constituted 225 sq km of  area and with all the wards and numbers having been changed to include  them in the 800 sq km new BBMP area, the ward boundaries have also  changed and these changes will have to be incorporated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new property identification numbers (PIDs) will be a complete  identity of your property - not just updation of ward numbers. They will  be ‘geo-tagged’ with the exact spacial dimensions of your property and  have the latest photograph of your house. After January, one can access details on the BBMP website about any property in the city using the PIDs.<b> </b>There are two teams assigned per ward. Each  team comprises engineers, a tax inspector and revenue inspector. These  teams have been going around the ward, mapping properties and taking  their photographs. They will be equipped with self-assessment scheme  (SAS) property tax data collection and verification sheet. Special  notice will be issued instantly to those who have not paid tax. For this  to happen, the BBMP officials will be working together with KEONICS for  immediate updation in the database.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With GIS-based property survey finally reaching completion, it will now  have access to a complete property database with details of dimensions,  directions and land use. Even the number of floors in each building can  be tracked. It’s a tough target ahead for the BBMP, with just a little  over three months remaining, to meet its Rs 1,500 crore estimate  from property tax for this financial year. As on December 9, 2010, BBMP has collected a total of Rs 904 crores from  10.12 lakh properties across the city. This is its highest collection  with the revised tax under the self-assessment scheme (SAS) The cost for  the base map preparation is around Rs 2 crores.
