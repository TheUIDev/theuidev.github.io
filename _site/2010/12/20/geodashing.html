&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Geodashing!?!? Sounds something similar to Geocaching right? Well, it is! Geodashing is very similar to Geocaching in the sense that people are searching for a particular spot with only a set of coordinates as their clue.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's how it works. In each game, a large set of waypoints, called dashpoints, from all over  the world is posted on the Web. Dashpoint locations are chosen at  random by computer, with all the unpredictability that presents.  Dashpoints might be in suburban neighborhoods or in the middle of  wilderness areas. Then, the race is on to see who can reach the most dashpoints before the deadline.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Geodashing players can participate as individuals or as teams of up to  five players to increase the number of dashpoints reached. The  competition is friendly and teamwork helps to get high scores, so put  your online acquaintances to good use.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because the dashpoints are spread all over the world, it doesn't matter  where you live. Dashpoints are as likely to be near to you as to anyone  else. It's easy to start playing. Pick a dashpoint, visit it, report  what you find. There is nothing to find at the waypoint. No box. No log book. No prizes...Getting there is <i>all</i> the fun.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, the rules are simple.  <br /><br /><ul><li>Pick a dashpoint. </li><li>Visit it. </li><li>Report what you find.</li></ul><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To know about the current dashpoints across the globe, please visit the Geodashing <a href="http://geodashing.gpsgames.org/">website</a>!
