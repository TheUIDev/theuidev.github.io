&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There seems to be a plethora of games and alternatives emerging to take  advantage of the affordability of handheld GPS units. In a previous  article on my blog, the high-tech treasure hunting game of <a href="http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.com/2010/11/geocaching-worlds-largest-treasure.html">Geocaching</a> was discussed. Learn about more ways to use the surface of the earth as your  gameboard. This article will provide an overview on two more GPS-based  ideas: Geodashing and GPS Drawing.<br /><br /><b>Geodashing:</b><br /><br /><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><span style="font-size: small;">G</span>eodashing is a game       in which players use GPS receivers on a playing field that covers the entire       planet. The waypoints, or dashpoints, to be reached are randomly selected.       The win goes to the one who can get to the most dashpoints; i.e. if you can       get to them at all! Each game has a new set of dashpoints making each game       completely different and unpredictable. <a href="http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.com/2010/12/geodashing.html">Click</a> to know more of this interesting game...<br /><br /><b>GPS Drawing:</b><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The GPS Drawing Project seeks  to display GPS-based artistry created by navigating through a landscape  with a GPS unit. The resulting linear trail collected by the GPS Data  Logger creates the resulting art. There is a gallery of the GPS art that  the user can browse through. Each entry contains an interactive  shockwave called “<em>GPS-o-shockwave</em>” of the GPS route as well as a  description of the area the artist navigated. Accompanying the  GPS drawing is an aerial of the area navigated with the route overlaid.  The art isn’t just restricted to land, but can include drawings obtained by sea and by air. The submittal of GPS art is open to anyone. ASCII files of the GPS  points are also welcome. There is also a  shockwave application where you can copy and paste your GPS data points  to see what your GPS-based art looks like. <a href="http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.com/2010/12/gps-drawing.html">Click</a> to know more of this artistic GPS game...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do drop in your comments about what you think about this article and these innovative GPS based games!
