<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following up on the last example where we saw how to add a hard-coded polyline to our map, today we will see a more user interactive polyline example. In this example we will discuss on-click polyline! What you need to do is, copy the following code into a txt file and save it with dot html (.html) extension and then view it in your browser. So here goes the code!<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/xvHDM/embedded/" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></iframe><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The output of the above code will be a map centred at Mysore. Click on the map for the first time and a marker will appear there. On the next click, another marker will appear with a polyline between the 2 markers. This will continue for all further clicks and here you have your "On-click polyline" running! The map looks something like seen in the image below!<br /><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next step to this code will be creating a polygon. We will see examples to create polygons on the map at a later stage!
