<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's start with the obvious question first...What is Panoramio? Panoramio is a geolocation-oriented photo sharing website. Panoramio website was officially launched on October 3, 2005 by Joaquín Cuenca Abela and Eduardo Manchón Aguilar, two Spanish entrepreneurs and was acquired by Google in July 2007.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accepted photos uploaded to the site can be accessed as a layer in Google Maps, with new photos being added at the end of every month. The site's goal is to allow Google Maps and Google Earth users to learn more about a given area by viewing the photos that other users have taken at that place. The website is available in several languages and can be viewed <a href="http://www.panoramio.com/">here</a>.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may add photos from Panoramio as a layer to your maps using the PanoramioLayer object. The PanoramioLayer renders a layer of geotagged photo icons from Panoramio on the map as a series of large and small photo icons. Let us now have a look at the following code to understand the concept in more detail.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/JhVRS/embedded/" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></iframe><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can copy the above code in a text file and save it with html extension. Open the file in your browser and you will see a map centred at Pune, India. The output of the code is as ssen in the result section above.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By default, clicking on a photo icon within a Panoramio layer brings up an info window with a larger photo and more information. You may remove this default behavior by setting the layer's suppressInfoWindows property to true. This is a basic example on Panoramio Layer. More examples coming soon...! Till then, keep mapping!..</div>
