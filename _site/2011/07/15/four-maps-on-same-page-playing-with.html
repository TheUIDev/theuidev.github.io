<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In today's example we will see how to add 4 maps on the same web page and then play a bit around with some events in Google Maps API. Lets have a look at the code. All that you have to do to get the code working is copy the code in a text file and save it with .html extension. Open this html file in your browser and you will see the four maps in action!<br /><br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/CKrCN/embedded/" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></iframe><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adding the four maps on a webpage should not be a challenge anymore, and all the more after the example <a href="http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.com/2011/06/two-maps-on-same-page-side-by-side.html">Two Google Maps - Side by side</a> that I shared a few weeks back! All you need to pay attention is to the events. There are two events "drag" and "zoom_changed". As the event names suggest, when you will drag or zoom the first map (upper left map), the remaining three maps will also zoom and pan accordingly! Try it out and leave a comment of what you think of it! You can also drop your queries or doubts about the same here!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The output of the above code appears as seen in the results section above! Hope you enjoy this example!<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div></div>
