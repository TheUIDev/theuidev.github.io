<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; India is mapping out its newest national asset, a state-of-the art  online information bank, which promises to transform governance, aid  planning and make life easier for the man on the street. Called National  GIS, this geographical information system powered service would be the  first one-stop database of India's natural and physical assets,  providing information and services about government schemes and  businesses -- right from locating malls, hospitals or ATMs to lodging  complaints.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The locational data service, expected to be fully operational in 3  years, would be accorded the status of a national asset and can accessed  through desktops or mobiles. National GIS, which is expected to help  boost productivity and keep a check on wasteful expenditure, will have a  "citizen layer" that will make it possible for individuals to  geographically tag complaints and grievances on a real-time basis that  will be accessible to users across three levels-â€”government, businesses  and citizens.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will also link individuals with UID numbers to their geographical  location. The project is the brainchild of the Planning Commission,  which has set up a 12-member core group to work out the organizational  structure, technological base, costs and user interface of the database. In order to make GIS database a national asset, a proper administrative setup is required.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although GIS services are being provided both by the government and the  private sector, they are not standardized or even accurate. It is the  first time the government is dealing with the standardization of GIS,  which has been available in the US since the 1980s. If assets would be standardized, governance would become easy.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee's role is to lay the standards for GIS, such as the accuracy of the road network; stopping PDS pilferage by ensuring vehicles actually deliver to fair price shops;  property taxes can be accurately collected since people tend to  under-report; consumer indexing of electrical utilities to overlay the  user and the power network on the digital map; health and education  system rollout, besides others.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In its initial draft, the core group has envisioned a digital map with  geo-tagged spatial data--containing 36 broad categories--that can  currently be sourced from various government and private databases. The  government already has a sizeable resource of multi-resolution satellite  images and topographical and thematic maps. There are also GIS  initiatives of the <a href="">Natural Resources Management System</a>, <a href="">National Spatial Data Infrastructure</a> and <a href="">National Urban Information Systems</a>.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"> <span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, none of these are integrated with each other, making it  impossible for one government agency to use information of another while  alienating private stakeholders altogether. The GIS map will source data from the Planning Commission, census,  infrastructure and sectoral datasets of ministries and states and  integrate it in one national frame. For the process of integration, the  core group has suggested establishing an Indian <a href="">National GIS</a>  Organisation (INGO) that will be the main agency implementing the  programme. The first organisation to benefit from such an exercise will  be the Planning Commission, which will get a "Plan GIS" in a year if the  proposal is cleared by the government.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;Source: <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/">Economic Times</a></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"> </div></div>
