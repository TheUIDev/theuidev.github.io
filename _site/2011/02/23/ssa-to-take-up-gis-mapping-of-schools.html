<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Karnataka, has embarked upon an  ambitious project of mapping nearly 74,000 educational institutions,  including junior colleges, in the State using the geographical  information system (GIS) to bolster education by making best use of  school infrastructure and to facilitate planning and development.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karnataka is the fourth State after Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and  Chhattisgarh to go for electronic mapping of schools, including aided  and unaided schools. There are about 46,000 primary schools, 12,000  primary aided schools and 16,000 high schools and junior colleges in the  State.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The GIS mapping of schools in the State may be taken up on the  model developed in Andhra Pradesh. The GIS software developed in Andhra  Pradesh is being customised by the National Informatics Centre for  storing, analysing and displaying geographical data of schools.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Union Ministry of Human Resource Development has given the green  signal to the SSA-Karnataka for taking up the project in view of the  Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act or Right to  Education (RTE) Act, 2010.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data collection will be undertaken by visiting schools and at least 10 photographs of infrastructure in each school such as  classrooms, playground, drinking water facility, school compound,  toilets, etc., will be incorporated in the project.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GIS mapping of schools would help  strengthen school education and serve as a key tool for planning and  developing school infrastructure after taking geographical factors into  consideration.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data on schools updated every year by the Department of Public  Instruction will be incorporated in the project. The project would help  the authorities to know the exact location of schools, distance between  two schools, and habitations that lack schools. It would take at least eight to 10 months for collecting  field data. The GIS map of schools would be ready by December-end or  early next year.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Karnataka State Remote Sensing Applications Centre would be  supporting the project and added that data on roads,  water bodies, human habitation, green cover, etc., would be  incorporated while mapping schools.</div>
