<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first time in India, Manipur has introduced Geographic  Information System (GIS) for mapping schools located in remote areas of  the State.&nbsp; The GIS was launched by the State with technical support from Delhi  based Mission of Geo-Spatial Application which is an agency of the  Central Government.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the GIS, State Mission Authority of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan  scheme has undertaken a mapping exercise of 4640 Primary and Upper  Primary schools located in different parts of the State. In addition to mapping 4640 schools, the same exercise has identified  1093 different places where there is no school and in need of     schools.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the implementation of the Right to Education Act in India which  lays down that schools should be located within a specific distance from  human settlement areas, the need for using GIS for mapping schools  located in far off places was felt all the more. The mapping of all the Government and aided Primary and Upper Primary  schools was enabled after collecting the longitudes and latitudes of the  schools through GPS.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the introduction of GIS, effective monitoring can now be done  whether or not funds sanctioned for development of school infrastructure  have been properly utilised which are otherwise physically inaccessible  due to bad transport infrastructure or because of security reasons. This will definitely prove to be a great step towards creating a corruption free India.<br /><br />Source: <a href="http://www.e-pao.net/">E-Pao</a></div>
