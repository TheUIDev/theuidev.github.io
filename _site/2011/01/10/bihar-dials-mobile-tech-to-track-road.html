<div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upwardly mobile Bihar is now set to become the first state in India to use the latest cell phones for centralised monitoring of road construction. In an <a href="http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.com/2011/01/cops-using-new-device-to-track-down.html">earlier post</a> we saw how the Bihar police were using the GIS technology to track down the criminals.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bihar State Road Development Corporation  (BSRDC), under the Road Construction Department (RCD), will deploy  Android phones to help executive engineers keep an eye on road  construction from district headquarters, while the RCD Secretary will do  so from the Patna office.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier, Bihar State Bridge Construction  Corporation had successfully used GPS-enabled phones to help mobile  inspectors track engineers on duty. The latest mobile operation system  supports all Google applications in 3G mobile phones.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the latest Android technology, assistant or executive engineers  will visit construction sites every two days to take pictures of  constructed roads and upload them on the RCD website. Photos taken using  these phones would verify that the pictures have actually been taken at  the site of the construction. To ensure double compliance of work done,  the RCD Secretary will monitor the same using Google Maps, available on  the phone.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the government is convinced of the  usefulness of the technology, all 200 engineers in-charge of road  projects under the RCD would be given the phones, said RCD Secretary and  BSRDC Managing Director Pratyay Amrit.</span></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Source: <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/bihar-dials-mobile-tech-to-track-roadbuilding/730072/0">Indian Express</a> </span></div>
