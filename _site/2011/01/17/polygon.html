<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After having seen a number of examples of polyline using the Google Maps API, the obvious next step is to create polygons on the map! Today, we will start with a simple polygon example and later proceed with a few more ranging from simple to a little more complex! Let us now move on to the code. Copy the following code in a text file and save the file with .html extension. Click on this html file and it will open in your web browser. You will now see your map in action!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this example we will see a hard-coded polygon, i.e. with no user interaction! No user-clicks, no drags, nothing at all! The polygon will directly appear on the map! Following is the code for the same.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/gF3Aq/embedded/" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></iframe><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The output of the above code is as seen in the result section above.
