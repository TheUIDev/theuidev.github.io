<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bunch of Twitter users have come together to gather information about  power cuts in India and make an infographic map to map the  geographical spread of power cuts across the country.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; It all started when Shefaly Yogendra, a London-based investment  consultant, saw a discussion on power cuts on her Twitter timeline and  suggested to her friends, "May be you guys should tweet #powercut with  location. The infographic will highlight the need for investment. To  many people." The idea caught on. Users had begun writing about the time and location  of the power cuts in their respective areas with the hashtag #powercutindia. Ajay Kumar, a software engineer, put up a web page that had started  mapping power cuts in the country on the basis of the tagged tweets. Now  the page can be accessed at <a href="http://powercuts.in/">http://powercuts.in</a>. A Twitter account by  the name of @PowerCutsIn has also been employed to collect data.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The page is built on an Ushahidi platform, which provides free software  for information collection. While the updates from Twitter are being  incorporated on to the map by a team of 11 moderators information  received via the smartphone app updates the map automatically.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; First city to be mapped, according to Ajay on Twitter, was Gurgaon. In  the first couple of days, 46 reports had been mapped, at a rate of 9.2  reports a day. These reports have further been sorted into categories of  "planned", "unplanned", "good news" (indicating no power cuts) and  "voltage". An open Google document, which anyone can read, edit and shared, was  also floated online, where people volunteered to do the data crunching  and provide tech support. Those involved are trying to take this beyond  an empty data-visualisation exercise and trying to figure out what to do  with it.</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Crowdsourcing, or getting a large group of people to provide data on a  particular subject, has been a rage ever since the web went social. A  similar mapping exercise, which maps mobile network problems in India,  already exists online by the name of Mobile Telco #Fail.  </div></div>
