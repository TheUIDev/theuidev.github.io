This test match that is being played between India and West Indies at the "master blaster"'s home ground at the Wankhede Cricket Stadium in Mumbai is the final match that he will be playing. The legend of cricket, the little master, the master blaster, the GOD of Cricket retires after this test match at Wankhede.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A billion hearts are praying for the great Sachin Tendulkar and everybody is paying their tribute to this great ambassador of the game of Cricket. Sachin has borne the burden of the entire nation throughout his entire career and has been the hope for a million cricket fans in India. I still remember, when I was a kid, I used to turn off the television when Sachin would be dismissed, knowing for sure that the Indian cricket team would loose the match after his dismissal. It would not be wrong, if I were to say that every Indian has wanted to be "Sachin Tendulkar" at some point in their lives.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The holder of several cricketing records, Sachin Tendulkar started off his career at the age of 16. Ther on he has scored a 100 hundereds in international cricket and an extraordinary 51 hundreds in Test match cricket. I have put together a small simple map, displaying all the test centuries that he has scored across the globe against different opponents. This is my small effort to pay my tribute to the greatest of the great.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; There has never been a great player as Sachin Tendulkar and there probably will never be. A small token of appreciation to this great legend of Cricket from me. Hope you all enjoy the visual representation of Sachin's greatest achievements.<br /><br />Link: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/FK6za/embedded/result/" target="_blank">Sachin's Test Centiries</a>&nbsp;(My Tribute)<br />Click on the Sachin Icons on the map to view a photograph of that particular test match with the record below the picture.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/FK6za/embedded/result/" target="_blank"><img border="0" height="360" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_KKTLmYMkz0/UoTG0Uj5gPI/AAAAAAAABhM/MfoEiS0AmP0/s640/Image.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div></div>
