The listview that is generally used is a ul-li structure. But Jquery Mobile allows the usage of the ol-li structure as well. The ol-li HTML structure will give the user a numbered listview. We will take a look at the following example to understand, how the numbered listview works.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/rhX7u/2/embedded/result,html,resources" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></iframe><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; As you can see in the result above, every list gets a number before the the list title. The numbered listview is useful when presenting items that are in a sequence like search results or a movie queue.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Hope you have followed this short tutorial and hope it helps you in your web application.
