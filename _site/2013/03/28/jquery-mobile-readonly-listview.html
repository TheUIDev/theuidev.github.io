<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Jquery Mobile Listview that is used generally used to link each list item to a new page in the application or to link that list item to another list. However, it is not always necessary to have a linked list. Sometime we need to display a list that does not have to be linked to anything else.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Using Jquery Mobile, we can have non-interactive, read-only listviews in our web pages. This list can be generated using the ordered or un-ordered lists that don't have any linked items, i.e. we basically do not include any anchor tags within our list item tags. This will render the listview as a non-interactive, read-only listview.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Take a look at the JsFiddle below. The code and the actual result will give you a better picture of how you can implement the non-interactive, read-only listviews.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/tRQEt/1/embedded/result,html,resources" width="100%"></iframe><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Hope you find this example useful.
