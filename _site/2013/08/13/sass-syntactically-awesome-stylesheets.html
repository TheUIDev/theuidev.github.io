SASS is really cool and it really is simple styling with a lot of attitude. SASS really makes CSS so much fun. I loved it and am putting up a few posts to talk about the various features of SASS.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; SASS is an extension of CSS3, adding nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance and much more. The SASS CSS is required to be compiled before it is transformed into standard CSS using a command line tool or a web-framework plugin. Let's not worry about this for now.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; SASS CSS can be written using 2 types of syntaxes. The most popularly used syntax is known as "SCSS", rightly named "<b>Sassy</b> CSS" and is a superset of CSS3's syntax. This means that every CSS3 stylesheet is valid SCSS as well. The second syntax is an older one known as the "indented syntax" or just SASS. This syntax is for people who do not love brackets and semicolons as it uses indentation of lines to specify blocks. Both of these syntaxes are supported by SASS, but we will be taking a look at examples using the SCSS syntax.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Hope you love all the examples coming your way detailing every feature of SASS in the next couple of days.
