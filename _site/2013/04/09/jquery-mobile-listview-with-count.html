<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; &nbsp; Today we will take a look at how to add count bubble for a list item. Jquery Mobile includes text formatting conventions for a list item with count bubble. The count bubble appears at the right end of the list item just before the right arrow icon, if it is a linked list item.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Like any other feature in JQM, adding the count bubble is a pretty simple task. Wrap the value that you want to display in the count bubble, in an HTML element like div and add the class ui-li-count to it. Doing this will add a count bubble to your list item. Take a look at the example below which will help you understand the implementation better.<br /><br /><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/QnQcF/1/embedded/html,result,resources" width="100%"></iframe><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Hope you have followed this example and have&nbsp;grasped the implementation.
