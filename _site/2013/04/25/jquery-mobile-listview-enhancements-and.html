<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; &nbsp; In this post today, we will take a look at the various enhancements and&nbsp;customization&nbsp;that we can do to the standard listviews. All these enhancements or customization are questions asked by various people on the Jquery Mobile forum. I have tried to put together a solution to some of them.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Let's take a look at a few of them. Some questions are really amazing like <span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;">"<b>W<span style="line-height: 22px;">hen i have 3 nested listview structure and moved to 3rd nested, how to move back to second nested listview?</span></b>" Now this is a really good question and a nice valid requirement too. When we had see an example on <a href="http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.in/2013/03/jquery-mobile-nested-listview.html" target="_blank">nested listviews</a>&nbsp;you must have wondered how we would navigate to the previous levels from the current level. Well here is a <a href="https://forum.jquery.com/topic/when-i-have-3-nested-listview-structure-and-moved-to-3rd-nested-how-to-move-back-to-second-nested-listview" target="_blank">solution</a> that I had put together.</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Another really nice question was "<span style="background-color: white; font-family: inherit; line-height: 1.5;"><b>Listview with collapsable listview inside</b></span>". This is really a good example to try out. Take a look at the <a href="https://forum.jquery.com/topic/listview-with-collapsable-listview-inside" target="_blank">solution</a> that was proposed and also taken from other jsfiddles. There is this another enhancement where we can "<b>Add a count bubble to a collapsible listview header</b> ". We had see an example on <a href="http://shreerangpatwardhan.blogspot.in/2013/04/jquery-mobile-listview-with-count.html" target="_blank">listviews with count bubbles</a>. We can add the class "ui-li-count" to only list dividers or simple listview. We cannot add it to a collapsible list. Here is a <a href="https://forum.jquery.com/topic/count-bubbles-with-collapsibles" target="_blank">solution</a> wherein we can achieve it with the closest possible style.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Some minor looking style changes like "<b>Changing collapsible div color</b>" can also be easily achieved with something as seen in this <a href="https://forum.jquery.com/topic/change-collapsible-div-color" target="_blank">solution</a>. On a number of occasions when we are deep into coding something really complex we tend to forget the most basic stuff and then end up facing issues like "<b>Adding a missing icon to a listview</b>". Well the solution to this was very obvious and simple. The link/anchor tag that is required to get an "arrow-r" icon on the listview was definitely missing. Here is a <a href="https://forum.jquery.com/topic/adding-a-missing-icon-to-a-listview-item" target="_blank">link</a> to the details of the issue.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Hope it has been a fun ride for you all so far. Hope you have enjoyed the series on listview and enjoying exploring the Jquery Mobile framework.
