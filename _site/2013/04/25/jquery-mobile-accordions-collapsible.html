<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; &nbsp; "How do I add a collapsible list to my Jquery Mobile application?" If this is the question that's bothering you, then JQM has a solution to this and a pretty simple one. You can style the listviews as collapsibles very easily and you can have individual collapsible lists or a set of collapsible lists (accordions). We will take a look at how we can achieve both of these.<div><br /></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Let us begin with the individual collapsible listviews. You can achieve a collapsible by merely adding a div with data-attribute&nbsp;<i>data-role="collapsible"</i>. This will style the div as a collapsible block with a default "plus" icon positioned to the left end of the list. To add a heading to the collapsible list add a heading tag (h1-h6) and you will have a left-aligned title for your collapsible header. After you have added the header, you can now have any content that you wish to include in the collapsible.</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Let's take a look at the example below to better understand the collapsible list implementation. We have 3 individual collapsible lists with different data-theme attributes. You can have a list open by default by including <i>data-collapsed="false"</i> attribute. By adding the <i>data-content-theme</i> attribute, you will get a border to the collapsible container.</div><div><br /></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/mgg3U/2/embedded/result,html" width="100%"></iframe></div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Now that we have created individual collapsible lists, we can club them together to create a collapsible set or an accordion as it is more commonly know. To do this add a div with data-role="collapsible-set" attribute around the collapsible divs and you will get an accordion. In the collapsible-set or the accordion, only one collapsible list would be open at a time. Refer to the following example to understand the implementation of a collapsible-set or an accordion.</div><div><br /></div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/Shreerang/q9snQ/embedded/result,html" width="100%"></iframe></div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Hope you have followed how to create a collapsible list and a collapsible set.
