<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp; &nbsp; In today's post I will finally answer a burning question that I have been asked several times by several people over the last month. Most of you all are aware that my first technical book - <b><a href="http://amzn.com/178355908X" target="_blank">Mastering jQuery Mobile</a></b> got published last month. I received several questions from people asking me how I did it? How did I get a chance and so many more, but the question that almost everyone asked me was "<b>Why do you have a picture of a tiger on your cover</b>"?<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KXRWKl5d5aA/VeeOlwZeICI/AAAAAAAACIU/CQWu9ZsLUyk/s1600/Joomla%2521%2BSEO.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="266" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KXRWKl5d5aA/VeeOlwZeICI/AAAAAAAACIU/CQWu9ZsLUyk/s400/Joomla%2521%2BSEO.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The Tiger Cub Cover Image</td></tr></tbody></table>&nbsp; &nbsp; Initially, I just answered saying it was chosen by my publishers Packt, but then people started getting more serious about the issue. People started raising other questions like did you have any other options, was there any sort market survey involved, any behavioral analysis and so on and so forth. This really wasn't what I had expected!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; So, finally I decided to find an answer to this burning question and now here it is! Yes, we had 3 options other than the Tiger cub which you can see below. The image of the Tiger cub was picked by my co-author&nbsp;<a class="g-profile" href="https://plus.google.com/115365810988718480506" target="_blank">+Chip Lambert</a>'s sweet little daughter and so we stuck to it and I must say that she has a pretty good choice.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5m0GY5Un9g8/VeeOl_kYVYI/AAAAAAAACIg/hkCURHYtMjU/s1600/1727EXP_Asher%2BWishkerman_paid.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="265" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5m0GY5Un9g8/VeeOl_kYVYI/AAAAAAAACIg/hkCURHYtMjU/s400/1727EXP_Asher%2BWishkerman_paid.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wy2KGsWsuWI/VeeOlUOJ5_I/AAAAAAAACIk/Tw2qH8PkDek/s1600/1770OS_Aniket%2Bsawant.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="266" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wy2KGsWsuWI/VeeOlUOJ5_I/AAAAAAAACIk/Tw2qH8PkDek/s400/1770OS_Aniket%2Bsawant.JPG" width="400" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4I_Lw7ZSD4g/VeeOl5bgYvI/AAAAAAAACIo/2rYVP9vBi-w/s1600/IMG_3749_-2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="285" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4I_Lw7ZSD4g/VeeOl5bgYvI/AAAAAAAACIo/2rYVP9vBi-w/s400/IMG_3749_-2.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div>&nbsp; &nbsp; I would also like to another question that I am sure some people will raise on this, which is, why were these 4 images shortlisted. This is because Packt has a set of images based on a series of books. So when the cover picture for our book was selected over a year back, these were the images that were available. If it were to be selected today, we would have some flower image as our cover picture.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Hope this answers the big question about our book - "Why is there a Tiger cub on your book cover" and hope you have enjoyed the post. In case you wish to order discounted copies of our book please get in touch with me and I can arrange them for you.<br /><br /></div>
