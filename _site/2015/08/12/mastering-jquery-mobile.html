<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://amzn.com/178355908X" target="_blank"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T_S6RdmCdF8/VcpXsSgoWoI/AAAAAAAAB_4/i8ewTcC5Lwg/s400/Book%2BCover.jpg" width="322" /></a></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Here is the reason why I have not been writing over the last 6-8 months! I was busy writing my first technical book - <b>Mastering jQuery Mobile</b> with&nbsp;<a class="g-profile" href="https://plus.google.com/115365810988718480506" target="_blank">+Chip Lambert</a>&nbsp;and what better subject to choose than jQuery Mobile. I have been extremely lucky to get the opportunity to author a book with Chip.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">This project started off about a year back, when I was approached by <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/mastering-jquery-mobile" target="_blank">Packt Publishing</a> to review this book that was being written by Chip. I instantly grabbed this opportunity, as I was getting a chance to review some work on a framework that I totally love. Chip had about 4 chapters complete at this time and I had provided my comments on the content of these chapters to the best of my knowledge. I was waiting for the further chapters, when I fine morning, I received a mail from the content editor of the book...</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">I thought that it would be the next chapter for review. But nope! It was him asking me if I would like to author this book with Chip, to speed up the process as Chip had fallen ill. Now this was a big decision to make, so many unknowns, the original code was not written by me, I did not know what was going to be a part of the further chapters, so basically I would be completely shooting in the dark! I brought up these things with the publisher and I was assured that the on-boarding process would be made very smooth. I finally decided to take the plunge!</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Over the next month, I received a whole lot of documents and the contract was signed between the publisher and myself. The work began. We split the pending work between Chip and myself and started working on our parts. The process went through several discussions and delays between managing our work and completing this project. However, we were able to complete the first drafts of all chapters of the book in the month of June.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">This was followed by proof-readings and error checks and then a couple of rounds of reviews and then finally the book was uploaded to the printers. The book was finally published on July 31, 2015. The book is now available for purchase at <a href="http://amzn.com/178355908X" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. In case you wish to purchase your copy or copies in bulk, you can reach me and we can figure out some discount on the total price based on the number of copies needed. If you already have purchased a copy, please take a moment to give us a review on Amazon.<br /><br />I also signed my first copy and that was such an awesome moment. Never in my life had I dreamt of writing a book, leave alone signing one as an author. But it happened when one of my colleague bought a copy and asked me to sign it for him.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HLAZG6l6W6U/VdDC_8HdZAI/AAAAAAAACAw/MIGZzGcDXX4/s1600/Book_Collage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HLAZG6l6W6U/VdDC_8HdZAI/AAAAAAAACAw/MIGZzGcDXX4/s640/Book_Collage.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div></div><div style="text-align: left;">Hope you enjoy the book and learn enough from it, as much as we enjoyed working on it and getting it out to you all...</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div></div>
